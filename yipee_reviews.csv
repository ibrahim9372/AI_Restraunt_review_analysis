"My mother and I accidentally stumbled into the pink door about a year or so ago. We smelled it and followed our noses.  Now we are hooked.. We try to go to The Pink door whenever we see a show in Seattle. It's not easy to get in unless you have a reservation but the food is amazing. Their Bolognese is perfection. From the pasta to the sauce it is what all other Bolognese strives to be.

We also got the gnocchi with gorgonzola cream sauce and pomegranate. It is rich but the tangy pomegranate cuts it just right. And the gnocchi is pillowy and light.

Service is friendly as always. Atmosphere has some strange elements when it comes to decor but even with some of the strangeness, it's still cozy overall.

I already have a reminder set to book our next reservation.

"The lasagna was amazing, but the Tuscan fries were disappointing … basically regular frozen fries with some large leaves on top and whole cloves of garlic sitting on the side (not presented in a way that you would eat it with the fries). The service was horrible. The hostess was extremely rude, and the rest of the staff seemed unhappy to be there and annoyed with having to help customers. The restaurant was cute inside but overall, I would not go there again. I would order the lasagna to-go if I could avoid the staff.

"Our party of three had a wonderful late lunch at The Pink Door. Our waiter was absolutely outstanding and very attentive to our requests. Two of enjoyed the market fish of the day: seared scallops with lentils, cauliflower puree and frisee. One ordered the gogonzola gnocchi with toasted walnuts and pomegranate. Our view table was perfect. Bravo to one of Seattle's classic restaurants.

"What a pleasant experience! We had the pappardelle bolognese, cioppino, and the Caesar. They were all delicious. We especially loved the cioppino which had a mild tomatoey taste not fishy perfect to our taste. I rarely order cioppino at seafood restaurants but was pleasantly surprised.

"Absolutely love this place. The atmosphere is very relaxed, the food and drinks are superb, so is the view and so is service (for the most part). I almost always order from the special or seasonal menu, and this time was no exception. Winter salad, scallops, special drink and espresso. The ingredients are simple but masterfully prepared. Sometimes difficult to get a reservation, so worth planning ahead. Highly recommend.

"This was our first time at the Pink Door, one night I will never forget. From the moment we arrived the ambience made the experience feel classy. The decorations and lighting throughout fit the mood. Customer service and special request were  accommodated positively and without hesitation. The menu was simple but not lacking, wasn’t an overwhelming amount to decide nor was it too small to not have options. The food was made at a high level with attention to detail and exquisite taste. It is where I proposed to my now fiancé and provided a night I can’t forget and will be somewhere we come for our special days. Go to the pink door, you will not be disappointed.

"We eat at The Pink Door at least once a month, and service is normally great. Last night, we had a server with no personality and would disappear and leave us frustrated. He never asked us if we wanted drinks or dessert. We had to flag him down to order, get our check. He never gave us his name when greeting us as if he lacked basic personal skills. The food was fabulous, so it was a bummer to have such a poor server especially since we had these reservations for a month to celebrate our daughter's return from college and my birthday.

"Service and atmosphere were great as usual.

Kale salad fantastic.

The meatballs quite terrible. Gummy quality. Over mixed. Not hit. A total disappointment.

The eggplant parmigiana sandwich was also worth a miss. It’s like ground up eggplant covered in cheese. The simple “teeny salad” was the saving grace, dressed simply in olive oil and vinegar.

Overall I wouldn’t rush back.

"Overall very good food, service and reasonably priced.  I gave it 4 stars because I don't give 5 stars unless it's outstanding.  The antipasto was good, but nothing special.  The bread was not particularly fresh.  I had the clam linguini which was heavy on the pancetta and too salty for me. 

 Had a butterscotch pudding dessert that was outstanding.

I would come again and try different dishes.

"Although the ambience was fun, the the food was delicious, and the service outstanding, the $33 (very small, 2 tbsp) addition of crab to my Caesar salad was NOT worth it.   In total it was a $51 salad. 

Now my son's $64 ribeye steak with wine reduction was memorable.  

However the crab addition is an unfortunate memory.

"We’ve been going to Pink Door for years when visiting Seattle and loved it every time. This visit it was a disappointment and won’t go out of our way to return as we did in the past.

We were not impressed by the food or drink menu, normally there are great seasonal options and this time it was just a basic menu with a sprinkle of seafood specials.

We got the rigatoni and meatballs, the noodles were overcooked and the dish itself was bland. We also got the eggplant parmesan which was garlic noodle pasta with 2 slices of eggplant heavily breaded with a lot of cheese. You could not really taste the eggplant and was disappointing.

We left without dessert after being disappointed and waiting for our server to return numerous times for prolonged periods.

Overall, we were sad to have this experience as we always looked forward to Pink Door when visiting. The food used to be exciting and delicious and the service was always on point.

"The Pink Door has a reputation as a classic Seattle spot, but the hype did not match the experience. The food was nothing special and several of the dishes lacked flavor. On top of that, our server could not have been less interested in us. He had to be asked to do basic things like clear our table and order more drinks, and seemed bothered by our simple requests. A total let down and not worth the money. Apparently it has lost its luster.

"I have eaten at many different establishments on both ends of the spectrum. Frankly pink door was a slight let down,my partner and I ordered 1 appetiser, 2 entrées and 2 drinks ( Did not get a dessert because nothing really caught our attention). Right off the bat the table layout in this restaurant was haphazard with tables anywhere they could stuff a table into. Service was not great either for example  our waitress waited for our table to be filled up with plates and bowls to the point we had to stack dish before clearing it.

The food was good but truthfully not worth the price (lasagna, fall special pumpkin ravioli,clam and mussels soup). And the the fall cocktails were most definitely not worth the price. All we tasted in our drinks was vodka and that’s it. 

Unfortunate let down.

Would we go back again? Probably not. Would we recommend folks to try it out for themselves? Probably.

"Everything was on point, from opening service, drink selection, bread service with infused olive oil, appetizers and entrees.  Atmosphere strikes a balance between casual and uniquely Seattle.  Perfect for a date night, dinner with friends and family.  Started with salads and seasonal soup, wife had pasta w/ marinara, a bright tomatoe and herb sauce with meatballs on the side, while I had the bolognaise, a decadently rich sauce.  Suggest getting a reservation from 6PM on so you can enjoy the entertainment.

The food, as always, was the best!  We highly recommend the Pink Door.

The only con, was the host reacted and spoke to us as if there was potentially nothing they could do and as if the incorrect booking they had was my fault, and not a system error. Baby talking to a customer on if we can be helped or not is not cute, should speak to adults like an adult. other than that they got us seated immediately

"I was disappointed with the red wine that they served. It was Italian. The noise level was horrible. They really should not play music because nobody hears it and it increases the noise volume in the restaurant because everybody has to speak louder. I complained to This Server about the noise level. I've been there customer since they open 1981 I was there the first week they opened. My friends and I could not carry on a conversation because of the noise level. The food was good. I had Cioppino and it was perfect.

"We always wanted to visit but our days off are the days they are closed. We decided to get a reservation finally after seeing all the good reviews and TikTok’s. We had to wait 45 days to get the spot we wanted and patiently waited in anticipation. The anticipation was the only good thing we had about this visit. While we had a 5pm reservation we showed up at 440 and was told to wait at the bar as the dinning room was not ready yet and they would come get us. Bar tender was nice and drinks were good. As we waited we seen people behind us getting seated and finally at 520 we were seated in the middle of empty seating against a down stairway. Window seats open and other better seating was open but were stuck there and felt like an outcast. Server came and was nice but clearly didn’t know the menu was she kept looking at a note pad. Drink order placed and she left, came back with drinks 30 min later and asked if we made a decision. We ordered the salmon chefs special and pork chop. Waited another 30 min for food never checked on again and had empty glasses. Food came and was less then acceptable as we began tasting the food, pork chop was very good, greens were mushy and little baby potatoes were undercooked. Salmon was over cooked, what we thought were mashed potatoes were grainy and tasted like instant, the vegetable was unknown half burnt and soggy as well. Served came back 30’ish minutes later and asked if we were done. Took the 3/4 full plates as we said yes and she left, not asking if it was okay. First clue to ask was $80 in plates 1/4 eaten. Came back with a menu and said here are our deserts and quickly turned to the next table and started talking to them. Left and came back 15 minutes later asking if we wanted anything. We asked for check and was promptly brought to us. We paid and left not being asked anything or thanked for coming. Need less to say we will never be coming back and lots of friends have thought about going here but after our visit not sure.

He completely forgot our drink order and we had to remind him when he asked us 15 minutes later if we wanted drinks.  He also seemed to forget one of our apps until we asked about it.  And we had to ask if we could place our main lunch order.  He wasn’t rude, just didn’t seem like he was present.

"This place is well-oiled machine. Service is efficient but that makes it a little impersonal. I sensed a vague annoyance that we weren't ready to order in a sequence that pleased our wait-person.
I had the audacity to ask if they needed to turn our table for the next round of patrons as we were feeling a little rushed.  And as I looked around probably about a third of the tables were cleared. So was this so folks without a reservation could be seated?  I booked months in advance and could only get a super early time slot, so maybe if I go again I'll just take a chance on a little later hour? Overall the food was generous and amazing , the combo of fresh crab with sweet corn seemed a little odd, but hands down was the almost the hit of the evening. tops for me was tied between the whole fish and my desert which was amazing, lemon peel with a marzipan was other-worldly. But no offer of a second cup of coffee we didn't feel encouraged to linger even as the room was clearing out. Another recommendation?  Ask for a table in the larger room with windows.  the first room is LOUD! And when the band started up I was grateful to be a room away. Will I go again?  Maybe, Le Pichet has better food, and Cafe Campagna has a quieter more relaxed ambience but the food needs  an update.

The Caprese Salad was a perfect starter with juicy and colorful tomatoes and a generous amount of mozzarella.  Our entrees included the Rigatoni with meatballs and the Pink Door Lasagna - both were flavorful and portioned appropriately. Our server was friendly and attentive throughout our meal.  My favorite part was the drink specials named Hello Madame President and We're Not Going Back, with a portion of each sale donated to the Harris campaign and matched by The Pink Door.

"Hugely overrated. My tomato and olive oil European partner could not believe how much we paid for the quality of food we got. The “very good” olive oil we were served wouldn’t cut it to be on Mercadona shelves (maybe barely? but either way not restaurant quality). Bathrooms were cheaply decorated. Please go somewhere else; nice restaurants in Seattle do exist but just not this one.

"I have lived about 1.5 hours away from seattle for 30 years. I have never tried this restaurant before but have always wanted to try it and now I have. I thought it was located elsewhere in post alley But we found it very easily. This is a wonderful restaurant. It is very pretty inside as you walk through.  We went for lunch. We each had a drink, one with alcohol, one without. The Dicky and Hello Madame President (I can only hope). They were very good. My husband had the papparedelle bolognese which he enjoyed. I had a tiny taste, I have had better elsewhere but these n.w. seafood was just plain delicious. That halibut was beautiful. I wished I had more, even though the serving was not small. The sauce was great and the peppers were not spicy as I thought they would be. I would order that again any day. I really didn’t know what to have, several good looking things on the menu. Glad I had this.

"The Pink Door is one of my favorite restaurants, period. The quality of the food, the ambiance, the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff and the overall experience are reliable top notch. This latest visit was no exception.

It's difficult to choose a favorite dish at The Pink Door because I've literally never had anything I didn't absolutely love. This time, we did the arancini as an appetizer and they were pure heaven. Crispy on the outside, filled with gooey cheese on the inside and topped with a Calabrian chili read sauce that was just the right kick to complement the creamy goodness. I opted for the pistachio cream trenne pasta which was an excellent balance of nuttiness and light creaminess. My partner did the lasagna, which is a Pink Door favorite for a reason. It's layers and layers of goodness. We skipped dessert this time but we saw a lot of people enjoying the grilled nectarine option, which looked amazing.

The Pink Door is simply one of Seattle's true dining gems. If you've never been there, go. If you have been, keep going. It's a great date night spot, fun for groups, and excellent when hosting out of town guests. You simply can't ever go wrong with this restaurant.

"A++! 100% recommend to locals and visitors! We were greeted by one of the restaurant managers (Jeanne!) right at the door! Waited a very minimal amount of time for our reservation and had a lovely ambience of candles, the waterfront, the live jazz band. Food was to die for. Consider ordering a number of dishes and sharing with your date or family! Awesome, awesome. Will be back! - a Capitol Hill resident ;)

"LOVED the Pink Door!  First time visiting Seattle and landed a day-of reservation!  The vibe was quirky cool and the food was amazing!  The sourdough bread and house-infused olive oil was soooooo good. Wish they sold the olive oil… it was drinkable delicious!  We ordered the rigatoni with mama’s meatballs and the lemon risotto with prawns. Both dishes were amazing!  Sat on the patio, our server was great, and we just loved the entire experience!  Hoping we can score another reservation for our next visit… will be craving this food until then!

"The Pink Door can be a pass on your Seattle trip. The food, vibe and energy isn’t special and I would argue overpriced.

"We came to Seattle on vacation and before arriving asked around and did some research for the best places in town to eat. The Pink Door was recommended multiple times. Service was great, polite and fun. We started with the arancini and fig/goat cheese/prosciutto both were delicious. Entrees skirt steak, fantastic flavor, catch of the day, pan seared halibut was wonderful and the veggies cooked perfectly. Meatballs and rigatoni were a miss but we read good reviews previously, meatballs seemed tough and texture off for our liking. We had 7pm reservations on a Tuesday and we were seated around 725pm. 3 of us, bottle of prosecco, 1 beer, 2 apps, 3 entrees came close to $200. I would recommend to try at least once and definitely make reservations.

I wish they still offered takeout, but alas, it went away with the pandemic. The decor is fun, and the location is wonderful. I referred someone I met at the market to come here prior to flying back to Colorado. Hopefully, he did. 

Anyway, I encourage you to go, I will be back often.

"We have been to the Pink Door once 20 years ago. We live local so we are spoiled by being frequent visitors to the market. We came to celebrate my husband's 71st birthday. I requested a birthday dessert for him. They did not bring it. So disappointed. We were staying at the Inn at the Market and went to the Electric Light Orchestra concert after dinner. We purchased a dessert to go. As for dinner- the arancini was delicious. The Caesar salad needed a touch of horseradish and anchovy. The bread was dry, needed balsamic vinegar with the olive oil. The lemon risotto with prawns needed salt. It fell flat. Prawns were a bit undercooked. My husband had the halibut- it was overcooked and dry on a bed of lentils with some yellow grape tomatoes and sauce. Mediocre. Probably will never return. Not recognizing a 71st birthday is just not right. This restaurant could improve.

We had the Alaska cod and Rigatoni with Meatballs.  Very flavorful and filling, without being heavy. So fresh!  The dessert of berry cobbler with gelato was buttery crisp and full of fruit.  My husband had the Lillet wine and I had the watermelon and rosewater lemonade.  Our waiter was just the right amount of helpful.  We live in the Napa Valley and when we travel to Seattle we make sure the Pink Door is on our agenda.  The only negative is that sometimes they are totally booked - they are that good!

"Ate there on a Saturday afternoon.  The food was fair, nothing to drool over. We got the fries as an appetizer and they were good, warm, crispy and aromatic since they were friend with herbs. The eggplant Parmesan sandwich was solid. Meatball sub was very large and two adults shared it and were full afterwards. The service was terrible!!! Took forever to get our food, had to ask multiple times for refills on our drinks. We sat outside which made more a little more pleasant experience.  I think it’s overrated and the restaurant needs a rest to not be such a tourist attraction.

"We recently had lunch at The Pink Door and were thoroughly impressed. The food was excellent, with each dish offering a unique and flavorful experience.

However, what truly stood out was the exceptional service from Amber. She was attentive and went above and beyond to cater to our group’s various concerns and food allergies. Amber made thoughtful accommodations and even suggested creative solutions that ensured everyone had a great meal.

Her professionalism and dedication made a noticeable difference in our dining experience. If you’re looking for a place that combines great food with top-tier service, The Pink Door is a fantastic choice.

"Excellent food. Tender, fresh salads dressed expertly with herbs and best quality olive oil. Also, these people know their tomatoes. Superb. Pasta is handmade, delicious, although could do with a larger portion. Halibut special was solid. A bit overcooked for my taste but my dining partner thought it ideal. The carrot puree and basil puree that came with the dish were lick-worthy. Berry crisp was excellent, good balance of sweet and tart and crisp. Not too much ice cream on top, and the ice cream was good quality. Wine list had good selection with varied price points. Would go again for special meal, but it was expensive. For two people, two apps, two entrees, a bottle of wine ($65) and dessert, the meal came to $260.

"Was amazed to see the length of the lineup but it moved quickly. Giant space and loved the patio area service was attentive. The bruschetta was great 4 servings of a slice of tomato on crusty bread with a delicious olive oil. The paradise was outstanding. The Congolese could have used a little more seasoning. The non-alcoholic Dicky was bitter and wouldn’t recommend. The berry crumble was a fantastic finish to lunch. Highly recommend even without a reservation as people in the walk up didn’t have to wait long.

"Over the past decade, Pink Door has gone down year after year.  From food quality to the ambience! This evening with a 5p reservation (opening hour for dinner) sitting at the bar. Service was absolutely horrible. Food was mediocre at best, their special was something out of a can with random cuts (chunks) of onion. Music was that of an 90s night club and loud.  This has truly become a tourist experience, one to simply say you’ve been. Pink Door is a complete miss!

"We heard a lot of great reviews about the Pink door so we were looking forward to the lunch. However, we left disappointed. While the food was delicious especially salmon and tranne, the service was lacking. When we showed our waitress the rock in the clam linguini, she did NOT apologize or do anything about it. It seemed this was not a surprise to her. Also, we were there to celebrate birthdays which was noted in the reservation but except the host wished us happy birthday the waitress did not acknowledge that at all. Overall, pink door is overrated, not worth revisiting.

"My husband and I come every year for our anniversary when we are able. I always mark that this is for that event in the reservation, but it was not acknowledged on this visit. Why bother to ask on the reservation if it doesn’t mean anything?

The food was good as usual, but maybe not as good as it has been in past visits. They are top tier about refilling your water here though! 

I don’t know, it’s just our special place, and it’s sad that they don’t acknowledge the event. In years past we’ve gotten a glass of Prosecco, or even a simple “happy anniversary.” Sorry if I’m just sounding like a complainer. 

I also felt a little rushed out at the end by our waiter, but I understand that they’re busy.

We were thoroughly impressed.  Delicate, balanced flavors.  Fresh ingredients. Fun/classy/unique environment.  The service was attentive without being in the way.
While not an inexpensive meal, I felt it was reasonable for what you get.  We will be back.

The lasagna has a touch of pesto which added to the dish and made it pretty unique. The bolognese was my personal favorite and I haven't stopped thinking about it since. The service was really nice and we were able to get seated right next tot the window since had a beautiful view. I will definitely be coming back.

"Pink door has always been a treat since I discovered it seven years ago. Every July I've come here solo to have lunch to treat myself for my birthday. A glass of wine, a special of some sort, a main dish to my craving, and to wrap it up with a limoncello. 

The staff is wonderful, always an air of class, attentive, and making you feel at home. The food is to die for, making you want to come back for more, but enough to know, you need to wait, because it's that special. It's a treat. You don't indulge in treats. 

I moved to the other side of the country, and have been talking about Pink Door non stop for the last five years. She leaves you with a lasting impression.

"It was a lovely sunny day and we were seated in our favorite server's (Elyse Eng) section right by a window. We got the benefit of the sun without the heat. The food, as always, was delicious. Service was excellent. We had a concert to attend so couldn't stay for dessert, but I'm sure there'll be a next time in the near future.

One thing, there's gotta be a better way for you to handle your reservations. Had we not had to wait in line outside we would've had time for dessert. We waited at least 10 minutes before being allowed in to check in with the front desk. As it was, we weren't seated until 11:45 vs. our 11:30 reservation time.

Went to the Pink Door for an early dinner.  Should have gone when they have the entertainment. I think that is what it is known for. Food was good but nothing special.

Could only get a 3:15 reservation and at 3:15 the restaurant was pretty empty…..,"Dined on June 1, 2024",3,3,5,4,the-pink-door,2024-06-01

"This place is very cool. Unassuming from the Pink door entrance, the ambience hits you from the moment you open the door and step into the landing at the top of the stairs. We wound though the restaurant and sat at a table with a beautiful view of the water. Our waitress was spunky and well informed. She helped lead us to some fantastic dishes which we shared. The Pink Door Lasagna was amazing and pair well with an order of meatballs. The Linguini Alle Vongole was excelent. We also ordered the Oysters on the half shell, and for dessert the Rhubarb and Donut holes (they both had better names but I don't recall them). Everything was just fantastic! We booked a month in advance and had to settle for 9pm, but with the view and ambience as the sun went down the timing was perfect.

The food - linguini vongole, arancini, spring risotto, and a glass of sauvignon blanc was excellent.

The service was friendly, knowledgable, and energetic.

This restaurant has long been one of my favorites, and I cannot recommend it more highly.

"This place is everything.  And it all starts with a mysterious pink door with no name.  We got there right before 1130 and the place was already garnering a line.  I thought all of us were going to rush the insides when the door opened.  And when it opened. What a delight.  Like opening a jewel box lid and seeing all the sun sparkled gilt and oil paintings and friendly staff.  The view in the back of the giant ferris wheel and the water is to die for.  And then to eat ... in those rooms .. with that view.. and the attentive, laid back staff.  The sweet/crisp/bright green/tender butterbean lettuce salad was so vibrant with flavor and greenness.  Butterbeans remind me of my grandmother.  And these were clearly from a nearby farm. The fish - grilled to perfection over a bed of crisped potatoes and greens.  The rhubarb pavlova - a tangy pink delight draped over a giant cloud of meringue.  A true slice of heaven.  Cant recommend enough!!  A favorite meal of a lifetime!

"This was my first time at he the Pink Door.  Not sure why I waited so long, it is a wonderful place with amazing food and outstanding service.  Had a table for two at the window, the view was spectacular at sunset.  We tried a little bit of everything on the dinner menu and it was all fantastic.  the tuna crudo melts in your mouth, the pasta course was cooked perfectly, the lamb chops were served rare and were crave worthy.  Also tried three of the deserts and they were all delicious.  Best dining experience in the Market area that I had had in a while, Well done Pink Door, keep it up, we will be back soon

"For all you go through to get a reservation, the food actually should’ve been better… The advertisers were great, but the entrées seem to be pedestrian… The linguine clam sauce was very dry and didn’t have much in the way of interest… The meatballs were excellent but we’re not served with enough sauce. They gave us maybe a tablespoon of sauce. I understand the Italians don’t use a lot of sauce, but this wasn’t enough sauce, the majority of the pasta was dry.
￼ the space is lovely and the service was excellent, but at the end of the day you go out to dinner for the food and I don’t think it added up

"My husband & I had an early dinner at the pink Door and felt it was worth the hype. We sat in the back dining room with the windows overlooking the water. The noise level was significantly lower than the front room. The ambience is eclectic which unique wall art & a mix of textiles. Our table was fabulous- we were in the corner by the windows.
Our waitress was excellent. Very friendly, professional & knowledgeable. We had Caesar salad, PAPPARDELLE AL RAGÙ BOLOGNESE & fish of the day. The bolognese was excellent. The Caesar salad was just ok - nothing special. The fish was cooked beautifully but it was served on lentils which were just ok.   WeI would definitely come back.

"Pink Door has been a Seattle favorite for decades; over the last few years, getting a reservation has been like getting an audience with the Pope. I understand that they have cut their reservations in order to ensure that they have room for walk-ins. I appreciate that. Just getting in is the biggest issue; otherwise, the food is terrific, the vibe has always been awesome, the service friendly...just great food in a casual, fun setting. Highly recommend if you can score a reservation, and probably worth the wait if you don't (they'll take your number, have you walk around Pike Place Market, and let you know when a table is opening up).

"Our server acted like he wanted to be anywhere but there. We told him about a birthday in our group and his comment was “ I don’t sing and dance” - we never asked him to do either. We observed other servers taking a small dessert with a candle to other guests and wishing them a happy birthday.  We were asking questions about the menu and he was obviously annoyed by that.  Sadly, the birthday girl in our group was so excited to eat here for her birthday dinner and we felt bad because while the food was amazing the service made us feel unwelcome and like we were inconveniencing our server by our mere presence.

"Rarely does a restaurant experience go so far above and beyond my expectations that I feel I have so much to write about every single part of the experience. We made a reservation for the pink door because we had heard it was a can’t miss Seattle experience. The novelty of seeing an aerial performance during dinner was the initial draw and it did not disappoint, but the service, food, and ambiance were also excellent. Our server Elyse took excellent care of us and took special care to find a wine that fit our taste. The roasted beet ravioli and artichoke pasta were both amazing and so different from anything we had eaten before. The ambiance was perfect for a romantic dinner. It was packed but we could still hear each other perfectly. We managed to see 3 of the 4 aerial performances for the evening and they were all stunning and unique. I cannot recommend this restaurant enough!

"The Pink Door was a wonderful experience on every level. From the Hostess who greeted us, to the person who escorted us to our table, to our waiter, all staff were friendly, engaged and knowledgeable. Our food was delicious.  Noteworthy was the wonderfully fruity olive oil presented with the bread and the sauce that accompanied the Arancini. Main courses (cioppino, eggplant parmigiana, and halibut special) were very enjoyable. This experience was a birthday celebration (89th!) for a mobility-challenged friend and everyone—including fellow diners—were kind and accommodating.  We had a lovely booth with a great view of the Puget Sound and all the maritime activity. The restaurant has a very warm and welcoming ambiance. Looking forward to returning.

My friend and I shared the fig bruschetta over cocktails, then had some yummy pasta before our entrées. The chicken was delicious, and while I had hoped to have a salad before dessert, I was too full to indulge in both! It was my friend's first time at the Pink Door, but will certainly not be her last.

"My friend and I were visiting for the weekend and we loved our visit to the Pink Door! Unfortunately, we had some complications with our reservation time/date and the staff were so kind and accommodating to help us find a solution! They were very busy and managing a lot, and still made sure we got to enjoy dinner with them. THANK YOU! It was our last night in town and you made it lovely.

The ambiance is very enjoyable - good lighting, detail in the decor, and there is live music. We had a beautifully positioned table in the back room near the windows. I had the caesar salad as a started, Bolognese for my meal (the sauce and portion were perfect), and then we split the olive oil cake. Our server was fun and bubbly. We had a terrific time. The location is also fun, tucked in a cute alley near other bars and restaurants and not far from the iconic market.

"Outstanding.
Food, staff, service always amazing.
My go-to at Pink Door:  Caesar with fresh Dungeness crab, and the best darn meatball sandwich in Seattle.  Don't forget a couple tasty oysters for an app.
In our opinion, the best value and service of any restaurant in Seattle.
Skip the rest, and book here every month.
You won't be disappointed!

"The Pink Door is a favorite of ours in Seattle! We’ve celebrated special events, entertained colleagues, and enjoyed long, leisurely lunches with our of town friends - it’s the best. Great menu, atmosphere, views, service. Yesterday’s experience was sadly not the best as our server consistently and persistently tried to rush us through our meal and out the door.  One crabby server having a tough day - it happens! Hopefully the next experience will be back to the high standards and fantastic experience we’ve always had here.

"The service was impeccable, with our waitress going above and beyond to ensure our comfort and satisfaction. Her recommendations were spot on, guiding us through a menu teeming with tantalizing options. We started with the La Fettunta, a simple yet divine grilled bread that perfectly complemented every dish by soaking up the rich, flavorful sauces.

But it wasn’t just the food that made our lunch great ; it was the overall experience. The blend of delicious cuisine, warm service, and unique entertainment in such a magical setting made our dinner at The Pink Door an outstanding adventure in dining.

"Reserved table through open table and requested window seats. We were sat in the inside room as there were no window seats available at that time. Before we could order, one table opened up. I requested the server, she asked the manager and the manager clearly didn’t even consider. We were told that we reserved a table for 2 and those are tables for 4. Fair. Then after 10 minutes I see 2 women seated there. WTF? Why were we rejected that table then?  Just felt wrong. Anyway, the food came. I ordered medium well lamb chops. Apparently if you want medium well chops, they will be burnt. The server tried her best. She changed and got my 2nd order. But I had to wait longer for food. Whenever I am here, I order their lamb chops and it was never this bad.  And the table thing felt like just mistreatment. Not worth the wait and the hype anymore it seems.

"Comfortable seating with picturesque views of Elliott Bay. Complimentary bread was a plus. We had the usual pastas...pappadelli, rigatoni and meat balls with marinara sauce, which were all tasty, flavorful and delicious. Pici con sugo di coniglio was their special rabbit dish offered that day...happens to be my favorite of the evening. Order if you see it or ask the waiter for it. So Good! Short rib with soft polenta was well seasoned. Vegetable sides of string beans and brussel sprouts cooked just right.
Service was stellar...top notched! Dishes came at a good pace. Will be back when visiting Seattle.

We all enjoyed our food, the lasagna was great as usual and we had a decent squid ink pasta. One small disappointment was the endive and apple salad which was so very small that it seemed almost to be a joke for $14. It was a lovely lunch and I appreciate having such a beautiful place downtown where I can count on having a nice experience.

"I was able to book a lunch reservation at The Pink Door and loved every minute of it. My server was fantastic. She was super friendly and attentive and shared a lot of items on the menu that were her favorites. I ended up ordering fresh oysters that came with a tasty red peppercorn mignonette shaved ice. I then had the clams/mussels. The serving was very generous and the broth was out of this world. It came with a large piece of toasted bread for dipping and my server also brought me some additional bread as a back up. :)  It was a fantastic experience and I could have eaten there 3 to 4 times and still not have tried all of the dishes that I wanted to order. There is a reason The Pink Door is so popular!

"I was disappointed that my guest's 80th birthday didn't warrant a cupcake with a candle.  Plus, I asked for a quiet spot because it's difficult for me to hear in a noisy restaurant. Yes, we were seated by a window but next to a very loud party of four. We should have asked for the table in a corner and skipped the view. But we were delighted with the ambience, the attentive service, and the food. Also loved that we were allowed to stay and talk as long as we wished.

"Overall my party of four was underwhelmed by our experience. The place is beautiful for sure. We were seated close to a window view of the water which is impressive as is the rest of the decor of the restaurant. However we felt our service was sporadic and less than expected. I had to go find our waitress 3 times for forgotten items and our check. It felt as if we were forgotten by the end of the dinner. Maybe our waitress had too many tables but our area was almost empty when we left. The food quality varied from good to so-so. We were informed the fish of the day was nixed due to the fisherman not being able to fish due to rough seas. I worked in the fishing industry and this seems like a made up excuse. Besides, your restaurant is next door to a major fish market! Also your website does not emphasize the need to be in the lounge to enjoy the entertainment when booking the reservation. This was not an issue for our visit since we had to dine early to make a different performance but I would have been disappointed if I had expected to experience this and been placed in the wrong area. Improve your website to inform your guests better ahead of time otherwise it seems deceptive. I will probably not dine here again due to all of these issues. Overall, disappointed.

"Not sure if it was the guests next to me or the server that bumped the table next to me, but I had hot candle wax spilled all over my pants and shirt. This was my first time dining here and I am not pleased with my experience. This incident ruined the rest of the time I was here. The servers just offered how to get the wax off my clothing, but never asked if I was okay or if I needed anything. Still paid full price for my meal which I’m thinking now if wax had gotten into my food. Not motivated to come back.

"I have to start by saying that the overall experience was great. And has been great coming back to this beautiful gem in Seattle.

The place ambiance is unique. The food and the staff are amazing. My only feedback is to the host/hostess team, every time I have been to the Pink Door, I have never been treated well. Not even a reply to a “hello” or “good afternoon”.

I have to say that this is only specific to that area of the restaurant. The rest of the team is amazing, helpful, polite.

"We made our visit to The Pink Door part of our annual Christmas dinner out - we’ve loved the food every time we’ve eaten there. The interior is very nice and we had a comfortable table in the back that wasn’t crowded. My only comment would be that the individual opening and initially serving our wine was so serious that he came across as unfriendly. Our waitress was nimble and took good care of us but I felt her friendliness was forced but get it - she’s extremely busy and the holidays must be tough in the restaurant business.

She suggested the very best highlights of the menu and was even able to have them recreate an amazing off-menu squid ink pasta and prawn Calabrian chili dish that I got my very first time in. It was delightful because I had been thinking about that dish ever since that first time I had it a year ago.

If you’re ever in Seattle, make sure you get a reservation for The Pink Door. It’s beyond excellent in every way. Every bite of everything we ordered was exquisite. From the scallops, to the affogato dessert, and every appetizer we had in between. This place is fabulous.

I would have liked her to check with the bartender or offer something similar but I was directed back to the seasonal cocktail menu. Understood why but it was strange to be told no without checking. The hostess was having an off night  - I know it’s high volume but she was a bit snippy with us and other guests and we saw her rolling her eyes walking back from seating someone. We had a reservation but got the table right in the walkway. We asked if there were other options but there were none. It’s high volume so it makes sense but it drew from the experience a little being in the entrance walkway. Chicken and mustard dish was stunning!!!!

My Hawaiian fish was good but nothing like black cod which the waitress said, more like halibut. My wife had a hamburger, I think, very good.  Had not been in many years but will return soon!

We had the  broccolini- charred deliciousness, Caesar salad-crip, not overdressed; & oysters- surprisingly bright & tasty, for the table. Our mains were grilled lamb, juicy, perfectly done; cioppino, packed with seafood, slightly spicy; and pasta with meatballs, loved the sauce & pasta, but meatballs were kind of bland. Bread was comped and an excellent bottle of wine, made it a perfect occasion with 4 satisfied guests.

"Wonderful hosts and ambiance. Interesting restaurant - very fun.  The halibut and linguine and clams were excellent.  Weakest link was the appetizers. Oysters tasted like sea water - not in a good way. Ahi crudo unfortunately had some white muscly pieces - ahi should melt in your mouth and not be chewy; other ingredients saved the dish. Server was nice. We would eat here again.

"I’ve been to the Pink Door several times and this was not my favorite visit. I have been times when the food was amazing - this time it was okay. I should probably have stuck to Pink Door specialities, like the lasagna, but I ordered the special (braised beef cheeks with risotto) and it was underwhelming. The server was delightful, the restaurant was busy and noisy, and our 4 top was out in the middle of the room which lead to a less than perfect experience for conversation, etc.

"Server was inattentive and disinterested - didn’t check on us, never asked how our food was. The food is usually amazing, but this time the garlic bread was unusually dry and the BUCATINI ALL’ AMATRICIANA was really terrible. If the server had come back to check in and offered I would have gladly sent it back for a different tried and true dish. In the end she must have sensed I didn’t like it because when it came time to box up our food she said “do you even want this?” when she picked up my barely touched dish. Was also my friend’s birthday which we put in the reservation and that wasn’t even acknowledged until a passing remark as we were getting up to leave.

"Loved our visit. I was going to get a spot next to the entertainment but alas I must have booked the wrong seating area.
Nevertheless the entire place has a great ambience.
A little loud since there is nowhere for the sound to go, but tolerable for my sensitive ears.

Food is really good, I did need to add some salt.

My partner has celiac disease (can't have gluten at all, not even something that touched gluten).
The server was knowledgeable both about celiac (didn't need to be explained) as well as extremely familiar with the menu items and what they contain.

I've been to other restaurants in Seattle in the same price range and the whole experience at Pink Door was much better.

"My girlfriend and I LOVE The Pink Door! We always come here every time we visit Seattle. This occasion happened to be for our 5-year anniversary. The hosts were so great, and they seated us at a nicely elevated table with a romantic candelabra. We were also lucky enough to see the aerialist performances during our meal, which made it even more exciting!

I cannot forget to mention the food. We had a nice Caesar salad, with the fish of the day (halibut filet and butternut squash purée on a bed of vegetables), the vegetable lasagna (to die for), and a side of grilled broccolini (extra charred but still soft enough to perfection). We cleaned our plates with great satisfaction and did not feel overly stuffed at the end.

Everything was absolutely perfect, and our date night was one that we will remember for the rest of our lives!

"It was our first time in a long time to have dinner at Pink Door. Love the new space-and Eric our server was the best. The food is very good- not over seasoned- salad dressed just right. We had oysters, the burrata, cioppino, a pasta and the green salad. Too full for dessert, my husband had a cappuccino that was excellent.

Overall, the food was good- the service and atmosphere were excellent.

Food was all really good too. Our groups shared Caesar salads, bucatini, rigatoni, clams & mussels and the spicy sausage with polenta. Our favorite was the bucatini! Very reasonable pricing.
Fun, iconic Seattle dinner spot!

I’ve probably been coming here for over 15 years at least. And I don’t even live in Seattle but whenever I come up, I always come to The pink Door.

"The Pink Door is amazing.  I was in town for a large conference and talked it up to my friends.  We were able to get a last minute lunch reservation, and it did not disappoint.  We got appetizers, entrees, and dessert.  No one rushed us, and it was a 2 hour lunch!  The lasagna is their classic must order.  Someone got halibut that was PNW fresh.  Ciopppino was excellent.  Seasonal dessert of pumpkin bread pudding was also outstanding.  Even the guy who doesn’t like pumpkin said it was good.  If you’re heading to Seattle, this is a can’t miss, make a reservation 4 weeks in advance spot!

Despite that we never felt rushed or that they were in a hurry to get us to leave. Their marinara sauce is the best thing I have ever put in my mouth.

"Honestly, for the effort it took to get a table here, we expected a little bit more, but overall it was a good experience. The only issue we had, was a very spicy mixed drink, and our waitress did not let me know the drink would be spicy when I ordered it. I was more disappointed in missing the live entertainment that they are known for. The dishes were great. The drinks were okay.. but it felt more like any other nice restaurant we had been to. I wouldn't bother with the effort of staying up late and planning ahead to make another reservation. I think expectation just beat out reality on this one, but the food was delicious, so you can't ever be too upset with that 😁

"We actually made the trip specifically to go to this restaurant as we were celebrating a special occasion ￼and made the reservation over a month in advance. The majority of our food was good. The raspberry basil cake is amazing! The trapeze artist was wonderful! ￼We were a little disappointed in the service we received. But perhaps our server was not having a good night. If we’re in Seattle again, will definitely give it another try!

The best dining experience in its class. Highly recommend,"Dined on September 17, 2023",5,5,5,5,the-pink-door,2023-09-17
"I strongly suggest you reserve in advance because it is a very popular place although there is a “walk in” line the waiting line is long and you might end disappointed because there are limited spaces. I used Open Table App.

When looking for the place, beware that it might a bit challenging to find because there are no outside signs or any kind of identification… just a Pink Door.

Food is amazing!
I had the Pink Door Lasagna… strongly recommended also the Basil Cake was really good!

Weather was nice so sat outside. Great experience!

Service was excellent! Staff is very kind and attentive.
Food came out at reasonable time.

If you want to have a wonderful experience in Seattle… this is the place!

The food was delicious, and any time out water ran out it was refilled immediately.

"Very popular place, had to book exactly 30 days in advance to get our reservation.  We were there for our anniversary with friends and we couldn’t have been more pleased.  Drinks, appetizers and entrees were all outstanding.  Service was impeccable, his timing was perfect, we were not rushed but he was there when we needed him.  

We ate in the main dining room, so did not catch the show which takes place in the lounge area.  That looks entertaining, but from the main dining room you have the amazing water view and sunset.  Different types of awesome!

The only thing that we were only very slightly disappointed with, were the dessert choices.  What we chose, to share as a table four (so full) was the basil cake which was good.  We’re all chocolate lovers, and so no options.

Highly recommend, but getting there can be difficult right now due to all of the surrounding construction.  Enjoy!!!

The Pink Door dishes are the most evocative of the taste and aroma of Italy of any place we’ve eaten recently, from the tasty meatballs and long-simmered sauce to the well-seasoned tagliata, preceded by a caprese and bruschetta - excellent, perfectly salted tomato on very slightly charred herbed/garlic toast, mmmm. The simple dishes are often the hardest to get right in a memorable way - and they do.  Excellent, friendly service with just enough attentiveness.

The food was tremendous (pork chop, risotto, cioppino, chicken and steak were all amazing).  It was a fantastic evening.  The only challenge was in getting a reservation.  Reservations open up at 12:01 am 1 month in advance.  There are not many tables for 6.  The only time available was 5pm which was a bit early.  And I was on at midnight to do this.  I’m not sure there is anything the restaurant can do about it, but that was disappointing.  Just know that to get a reservation you need to be trying literally at midnight!

"We wanted to like this place more, but it unfortunately did not meet our expectations.  The view was nice from being seated in the back, however part of the reason we wanted to come to this restaurant was to see the acrobatic show, but there was no way to tell if it was happening or not. Disappointing. However, the food was good, but not great except for the bolognese- I would highly recommend the bolognese. So delicious! The service was okay - we weren't huge fans of our waitress, so it made the meal a little less enjoyable. I'd still recommend the restaurant to a friend, as I feel like it deserves a second chance.

"We were shown to a very nice table in a corner by a window. Our server was very sweet and accommodating. We had been wandering and exploring around Pike Place so we were thirsty and hungry and excited to eat. The bread and olive oil … yum. Super hard to save room but we paced ourselves. Our antipasti was perfect. Gorgeous figs and surprising arancini. They make it with black rice! The caprese was perfect and the Caesar salad was well dressed if a tiny bit ruined by the need to use a fork and knife to eat it. I don’t know when restaurants decided not to tear lettuces into bite sized pieces anymore. Entrees next… my husband had the chicken parm which he said was delicious. My son went silent with appreciation as he ate the lasagna and only commented once to say he was glad we still had bread so he could sop up all the sauce. My risotto was tasty but very loose. Almost soupy. And some of the prawns were quite over. Our server gave us a complimentary dessert to make up for it and oh… those cherries poached in red wine and bay were so lovely. All in all we had a beautiful dinner. A very nice end to our vacation. Thank you Pink Door ☺️

"I’ve been to the pink door 4 times in the prior few months — I live in Arizona and travel 1200 miles to come here. The service is HORRIBLE. Never get refills; the servers are so rude; I feel like I’m ordering from a soup kitchen every time I explain an allergy. If you bring in a coffee from pike, you literally get screamed ay.

Definitely get their famous Lasagna (spinach pasta, so much flavour too), Clams & Mussels, and the side dish grilled corn off the cob. 
Dessert was also standout - simple, done well.

My reservation was for 3:15 and the last one available for a single. Deserving of its “must go” reputation, The Pink Door will be an unthinkable omission on my next trip to Seattle! Good LUCK getting a RESERVATION. You’ll NEED BOTH, or a lot of patience. I had the 1/2 Antipasto plate, the grilled corn OFF the cob, and the Caesar salad w grilled prawns. All 10/10!

The only thing I would change is that I wish we had chosen to dine inside instead of out on the deck. It was a beautiful evening so we chose the deck. It was very comfortable but didn’t feel special in any way. The inside restaurant is so incredibly beautiful and cozy that I wish we’d sat there to enjoy the wonderful ambience.

"Pink Door was a bucket list restaurant, and when we finally got a reservation we were not disappointed! I went with my partner to celebrate an anniversary. I put that note in our reservation details and was a bit sad they didn't congratulate or mention it, even though they were wishing others a happy birthday (this is not a negative, I'm just sensitive:) ) The food was amazing, the tomatoes for the bruschetta and caprese salad were the stand out. I got the Summer Risotto which was so so so good. My partner got the lasagna, which we were so happy to learn it was vegetarian.  5 star experience, food, atmosphere! Will return (if we can ever get another reservation!)

"The food was terrific! We brought a very, very good bottle of wine with us, paid the $35 corkage fee, and the waiter offered to decant it for us which was a nice surprise. I think he needs a little training on how to open a bottle however. Didn’t cut the foil and broke the cork off midway. I would highly recommend seating in the lounge. Best view of the show. It’s almost impossible to call and get someone on the phone. Hostess staff was super nice. We’d go back, knowing what to expect now.

"The drinks and ambience were lovely. The Bolognese was delicious. We found, though they had good flavor, the meatballs were dry. Despite putting a tree nut allergy warning on the reservation and reminding the waiter that I had a tree nut allergy upon my arrival, I was still served a desert that had tree nuts in the sauce. I could tell the moment I took a bite. He was extremely apologetic and said the recipe has changed since they printed the menu, which did not reflect tree nuts. Given the hype of the restaurant, I would’ve expected better allergy practices. The price of the desert was removed from the bill, but I would’ve expected a larger compensation.

Food seemed a little pricey, had to ask the server for our complimentary bread 20+ minutes into being seated, and had someone else’s dessert brought to our table.

"The Pink Door never ceases to impress.  What a perfect way to spend a summer day having lunch on the deck with my daughter and her friend.  They were able to accommodate us adding 1 person without any fuss.  Food was terrific, the service was all around great.  We ordered too much food because everything looked good.  Too bad there is construction nearby but not the restaurant's fault and it appeared they stop at noon for their lunch break.  I've already made future reservations since the place i so popular.

An interesting restaurant.  Appears to be a must-go when in Seattle.  Not sure I agree.  Service could be improved and being from New York - dishes may be a little different in Seattle.

"It’s been too long since my last trip to the Pink Door.  I was reminded yesterday of why it has always been one of my favorite restaurants- the food above all (Caesar salad with Dungeness crab), but the staff, the setting combine to make it an excellent experience.  It used to be a special go to place but given what restaurant prices have climbed to the value of the Pink Door stands out and I’ll be back frequently.

Ambiance- 5 stars! Seated on the outdoor patio and had a partial view of the Sound. Server was attentive and recommended the Pink Door favorites.

The Caesar salad was delicious- lightly dressed and the croutons were really outstanding. The lasagna was divine and I highly recommend this! The portions are large. I'm looking forward to my next visit to try the rest of the menu!

"The Pink Door was a top notch dining experience from start to finish.  The staff was very understanding of our drive to Seattle and held our reservation.  They were great upon arrival when I was seated with our daughter and my wife parked the car (not easy in the Pike Place Market area).  Our waiter, Eric, was fantastic and provided the right amount of service.  The food was excellent as was the decor and ambiance of the restaurant.  The prices of our menu selections were more than fair. We've paid a lot more in Southern California for a lot less.  I would put the Pink Door on the top of my list for dining if visiting Seattle.

"We came to the pink door because it was highly recommended by several friends. I’m not sure why, but our experience was nothing like theirs. Inside was beautiful, but we did have to wait a while to be seated (despite reservations) and there was no where to sit while we waited. 

While my salad was good, my husband’s noodles were very undercooked and the meatballs were just ok. We needed to ask after our meals were brought to us if we could have bread too like all the other tables…. We also were not checked on often enough for us to bother with more drinks or dessert as we knew it’d be a long time before we got those too. 

Overall, I won’t go back. Glad we tried it! But it wasn’t anything special.

"This place only operates outdoor during lunch time, you will expect to be really hot under no shade outdoor. The food was normal, nothing special. My husband’s risotto had no taste, maybe chef forgot to put salt. Also, the restaurant is not stroller friendly. If you have a baby, you can’t carry stroller with you. You may park outside. If you bring stroller, the restaurant manager or host, who owns that place will annoy you.
As this place was known to many people, we decided to visit, but food has no taste, we were super hot under the hot weather with no shade. Server and host were not kind at all. We had unpleasant visit.

"This was our first visit to the Pink Door for our 37th wedding anniversary and it was a win! Fortunately the weather was nice so we got to eat on the outdoor deck which had fabulous ambiance and nicely shaded with a trellis 'roof'. The server was very helpful and provided excellent service. The menu was great and difficult to make a decision so we'll have to return to try more entrees. We had the crostini  and 'Mamas' meatballs for appetizers. Both were awesome! My wife had the Bolognese and I had the Cioppino and they were also excellent. My wife had been wanting to try this restaurant for years (we don't live in the city) so it was perfect for our special occasion. We'll be back!

"Our standards for good service are the bare minimum: refill drinks as needed, ask us if we're doing okay, and don't rush us.
All 3 were lacking this time around. From the reviews, I was hoping for great service and an amazing experience, and we were honestly quite disappointed. Our server, (I won't say her name for her sake), was just not polite nor doing anything the right way. From spilling water everywhere, to grating cheese all over my friend's lap. The food was subpar, with the Lasagna Pink Door being a star. Unfortunately, I had no idea that Rigatoni and Meatballs meant having meatballs that couldnt even be cut. They were tough as rubber. Bread and olive oil was offered, but felt rather cheap and tacky. Overall, I hope that this place's service gets a revamp, as I felt that it was quite disappointing, since we had hoped for it to be a good experience. Probably not coming back.

The arancini was delicious, chicken parm was some of the best we’ve ever had, and the lasagna is just… I have no words. The lasagna is their staple dish for a reason… fantastic!

"The Pink Door is definitely a vibe! The entry is obscure which lends to the nostalgia of this classic Seattle eatery. We enjoyed the atmosphere, which included a great selection of live music performed by a visiting New Orleans musician. Our server was lackluster to say the least. It was obvious she wasn’t loving her job and should have been addressed by management for her borderline rude demeanor. Our food was as described, hot, presented well, and portions were large. Unfortunately, taste and quality fell slightly short. Our selections felt like an elevated approach to tourist attraction fare. Overall, it’s a great environment. Manage your expectations for subpar service/mediocre food and you’ll be fine.

Overall very good experience…. We had the pasta with Ragu. The pasta was super delicate and cooked perfectly, the mean Ragu was very good, and in the true Italian way, they did not totally French the pasta in the sauce - Bravo!!
We also got the mixed seafood dish, all fresh  and cooked perfectly as well!!!

"Very nice restaurant to celebrate our anniversary. We were seated at one of the best tables with a lovely view of the Puget Sound without our request, probably because they noted that we were celebrating our anniversary.  Great service, attentive wait staff, delicious food, and the nice view all made this a memorable experience. The only negative was the noise level. Because the restaurant was completely booked, the noise level of all the happy patrons talking prevented us from hearing the nice live jazz music well. However, we much preferred sitting by the window rather than in view of the stage.

"Love the location of this restaurant. Friendly hostess. I stopped by each time I'm visiting Seattle. I started with their simple Caesar salad and ordered my favorite pasta which was the Pappardelle al ragu Bolognese...comes saucy, cheesy and very flavorful. My husband had the linguine alle vongole with a side of corn off the cob. To his delight, the linguine was loaded with lots of tasty baby clams. Delicious meal and very attentive wait staff. Will be back!

Lived up to its reputation!  The fava bean crostini was a revelation.   The Penn Cove clams and mussels were pitch perfect.  The risotto was a tad overcooked - the rice had lost it's 'bite'.

"Nice cozy restaurant. Caesar salad was refreshing and came with garlic bread. Our only complaint was the meatballs appetizer in marinara sauce was overcooked and dry.  Chicken parmigiana was crispy and cheesy goodness. Clam linguine had lots of clams. Rigatoni with mama's meatballs was awesome. A plate of grilled lamb chops was expensive. Cabaret cake was very good. Restaurant was very busy. We were entertained with live music as we ate that evening. Restaurant provided great service. Hostess greeted us right away. Wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. Will certainly dine here again!

"I hate reviewing things poorly but this was one of my worst dining experiences :( We were sat at a table that was in direct sun and squished. Our legs could not fit under the table. We were facing a rooftop with a loud humming AC to look at. It felt like a forgotten table you’d put an unexpected guest at. Definitely felt like oh maybe these two young people wouldn’t mind being here… but it was extremely uncomfortable. The food was not stand out. The lemonade did not state it would be pink, and the added sugar/flavor was overwhelming instead of refreshing. The bread was nice. Our waitress was nice. When you make a reservation a month in advance, I think you expect more, but this did not deliver.

"Had a wonderful dinner celebrating our wedding anniversary. Everything was perfect. We enjoyed our Caesar salads, the bread and olive oil, our pasta dishes and desserts. Kristy was professional yet friendly and helpful in making our selections. She had a nifty way of attaching the cork to the wine bottle and taught my husband how to do so. We truly enjoyed ourselves and will return!

"Very elegant and classical atmosphere, unfortunately reservations for seeing live performances were booked up the butt a month in advance so lunch was all we had. Selection on menu wasn't exactly varied. Crostini ai funghi was cooked like taco meat and tasted like it too, with little to no mushroom flavor. My halibut was quite tasty however the bed on which it rested was lacking in volume, it only consisted of green beans and two large and bland potatoes. My dinner guest ordered the clam pasta and while the clam was flavorful it was simmered in far too much butter, an unfortunate trend that has spread across restaurants. It removes the flavor of the ocean from which it came, a quality that is supposed to be inherent in all seafood. Also our bread got delivered quite late, practically during our antipasti. Also it was cold. The fact that the food safety level in its window was just ""good"" was also very telling, in retrospect. Oh and that totally funny trend where places don't have signs out front? Totally helpful and chic. Not only was it in post alley but also it had a door that wasn't exactly pink pink, more of a very light salmon. That's just nitpicking tho. Overall, it was alright.

"The Pink Door is more than just a restaurant – it's an experience. From the moment you walk in, you'll be transported to a whimsical and romantic world filled with delicious food, fantastic drinks, and live entertainment. Located in Seattle's Pike Place Market, The Pink Door has been a local favorite for over 35 years, and it's not hard to see why.

The restaurant itself is a charming space filled with twinkling lights, colorful decor, and vintage photos adorning the walls. But the real draw is the food - the menu features a mix of classic Italian dishes and Pacific Northwest seafood, all made with fresh, local ingredients. The handmade pasta dishes are a standout, as are the wood-fired pizzas.

But it's not just the food that makes The Pink Door special - it's the atmosphere. The restaurant is known for its live entertainment, including aerial performances, cabaret shows, and live music. The performers often move throughout the restaurant, adding to the already immersive experience.

The drinks are also top-notch, with an impressive selection of Italian wines, creative cocktails, and local craft beers. And the service is always friendly and attentive, making you feel like a welcomed guest in someone's home.

"I went early because my friends could not make it. They were busy, but the hostess found me a bar seat from which I could see the circus performer who was doing a ribbon-trapeze type act. I can't remember what the apparatus is called. Very talented, strong, and elegant!

The Pink Door ambiance is one thing I have always found classy and charming. The hostess, servers, were very helpful and attentive.

The ciopino was terrific, and the barman brought extra bread to sop up the broth. I have had similar dishes - this was very good - but it was not in my top 3 for a ciopino so I gave it 4 stars.

There a lot of other nice choices on the menu too, at a good value for the venue and quality of the food.

I highly recommend The Pink Door if you in Seattle - just expect that a place this good will be busy. It is in a really touristy area, so walk in service is touch and go.

"I was very impressed with the Pink Door! It's so hard to get a reservation there, I was worried that it wouldn't live up to the hype! I shouldn't have been worried because everything we had there was fantastic! We had antipasti (half order), kale salad, lamb shank & chicken scallopine and to top it off the strawberry rhubarb crisp! Everything was so good. I can't wait to return! We often go to Carmines, Cantinetta and San Fermo - this was just as good or better! Thank you Pink Door!

It did not disappoint! The entire experience was fantastic starting with the hostesses being so welcoming.  Emily, our server, was just fabulous.  She was not only fun and kind but gave us all the recommendations for our menu selections that were perfect!

The food was delicious.  The Rice Balls, Lasagna, Bolognese, and the Almond Cake.  Every single item was outstanding!

The atmosphere was gorgeous and romantic.  Loved it!  Can't wait to go back.

We enjoyed the velvety Stevens Reserve Cabernet with mushroom crostini-so earthy, crunchy, and delicious! Then the citrus shaved fennel salad with blood orange and olives was bright and fresh. The pastas were sublime-the spinach lasagna and linguine with clams divine! Our only regret is we had no room for dessert! Oh, what a night!

"I've been here a few times and I really love coming here and I always bring someone with me. I was slightly disappointed because in Dungeness crab Caesar salad, I felt something very hard in my mouth and it was a crab shell. Then after that I felt another very sharp hard thing and it was an eggshell. Not ideal for a $30 salad, but they were kind and offered dessert even though not necessarily something I want to eat personally, but I accepted. I've never really had an issue before.

"Friends were in town for a convention and we were fortunate to get a reservation at The Pink Door. My husband and I both ordered the cioppino and it was amazing - fresh seafood, light tomato broth, with just a touch of spiciness. Others ordered pasta dishes, and the scallops - everyone was very happy with the entrees. Appetizers were a dozen oysters - fresh and delicious - and the antipasto plate, which was large, varied, and yummy. The House Red was OK, but single glasses of other wines, showed some excellent choices. Our server, Emily was great and other service staff were there when we needed them and did everything right. This is not a quiet restaurant, but in the back dining room the noise level was such that we could chat and hear each other. The atmosphere with soft lighting and windows overlooking the water was exceptional.

"Delicious Italian food that manages to feel both comforting & classic and bright & fresh. Entertainment was great. Service was spot-on. Ambiance was both quiet and bustling — lively but easy conversation-level. Fine dining but comfortably casual (not sloppy, but relaxed) and unpretentious. Obviously a real treat, but also a great value, which is a rare combination. Basically, this place manages to be everything all at once, without overstretching in any direction. There’s a reason the Pink Door has been beloved for decades. It’s a delight!

"So it's been a while since we were here and since then they have expanded into a larger, less cozy restaurant.  It used to be quiet, kind of dark and a nice place for a special dinner.  Now it's a lot bigger and noisier.  The food is still good and my wife's scallops were excellent.  My meatballs were good but nothing exceptional.  Dessert was a disaster with a burned gingerbread pudding served that was not edible.  We also felt that we were being rushed by our server as she initially came by every couple of minutes just as we were trying to get settled and go through the menu.  I think it will be a while before we go back.

The Pink Door consistently appeared in every search.  Because of the amazing reviews, I was not surprised with the challenges I faced trying to get a reservation.  I was determined and it paid off as I finally got a reservation online (it may be easier to call in).  My determination sure paid off because WOW, this place is amazing from walking up to this quirky building, the staff greeting my party, wait staff, ambiance and OMG...THE FOOD!  If overeating is a crime, then LOCK ME UP because I could not stop.  Every single entrée my party had was outstanding.

"Oh my, what a marvelous experience. From the near-hidden pink door entry to the classy decor, to the just-right attentiveness, and the no-rush pacing of our meal, I was smitten. And the food! I can’t imagine that any dish served here would be less than perfect, but here’s what we enjoyed: 

I started with the rosemary vodka gimlet and loved it. The tuna crudo was a complex and tasty combination of sweet and salty, and the portion size was ideal for two. The bread was crusty, lovely soaked in the olive oil, one of the best I’ve had in ages. At the suggestion of our server, I had the signature lasagna. Yummy! And not too heavy, and again, just the right portion size. 

We husband gushed over his linguine and clams. I begged for a taste and they were superb. We topped it off with the cranberry tart, not too sweet, and cappuccinos.

"Came here for my bday dinner. My friends hadn’t been here before but Pink Door is one of my favorite restaurants in Seattle! We sat in the front area where they have live music (
I’ve been probably 5 times before and always got sat in the back so I count this as a win!). It was a little bit loud but the music was great! The server was kind of rushing us a bit with our orders, maybe to get our table turned, but other than that he was very nice. We got the Arancini and Garlic Bread to start (both MUSTA), the Paparadelle Bolognese, Linguine w/ Clams, and Squid Ink Tonarelli (Squid Ink was AMAZING) for our entrees, and the Cookies, Bread Pudding, and Coffee/Donut for dessert (the bread pudding was the most delicious think I’ve ever eaten). Their menu is always changing so not sure they’ll always have these items, but just in case! Always planning my next trip to Pink Door!

"Not our first time, worth returning. As usual, we had impeccable service, this time provided by Emily C. The staff is knowledgeable and attentive, without being snooty or overbearing. Every morsel we’ve ever put between our lips, or sip we’ve swallowed, has been expertly crafted. We generally let the server lead us to their favorites, and they haven’t missed yet. (You must have the charred bread with whatever you order.) Tonight, there was a fantastic jazz trio performing, that topped of the experience. Don’t miss an opportunity to open the door when you’re visiting downtown Seattle.

"Another excellent meal at The Pink Door!

We missed the summer menu… wanted to order the vine ripened tomato bruschetta on crostini… but they didn’t have it on the menu so we opted for the porcini mushroom on crostini tonight!  Super yummy!  We took the champagne pink peppercorn vinaigrette that came with our PNW Oyster on the half shell and drizzled it on the porcini mushroom and it gave the app a nice zingy tang!  Jon ordered his favorite Pink Door Lasagna as his main and I ordered the fish special which was three good sized scallops on top of polenta and a frisée salad. Dessert was a super yummy espresso jello like dessert with an ok maple bar. The Christmas cookies were also a delight!  Wonderful meal!

"I had been been going here for over 20 years (I’m a Seattle original ;)) and it was always been amazing. I hadn’t been since before covid and the quality of food isn’t what it once was (or maybe we hit an off day). The papardelle noodles were cooked a little too long but the sauce was still amazing. The lasagna portion was smaller and barely had any bechamel sauce so the flavors weren’t the same. It was still good but definitely not the pink door I frequented for many years… the setting is great for the location and ambiance but I wouldn’t recommend to out of towners as a must visit place any longer.

We've been coming here for many years, each time we fly into Seattle.  As soon as we book our flight, we make a reservation for dinner at the Pink Door.

Only suggestion I can make is not to order a Manhattan.  They make other drinks that are really good.

"It’s been years since I’ve had the opportunity to stop in to visit. The Pink Door was one of the first restaurants I dined at when I first visited Seattle 12 years ago. Now that I’ve lived in Seattle almost two years, I’ve been chomping at the bit to go back and since my partner (hopefully soon-to-be fiancé) is visiting Seattle for the first time, I wanted to pull out all the stops to make it an unforgettable trip. Needless to say, it was a success. The Pink Door staff, food, atmosphere, performances, and drinks were nothing short of perfection. A huge thank you to all of you for knocking it out of the park every day.

"Even if you book the dining room, you can indicate on your reservation that you'd like to be seated in the lounge.  Bar seating was wide open the night we were there (Tues).  The aerial dancer cannot be seen at all from the dining room and it's tough to determine when she will be performing.  I booked exactly 30 days ahead of time. On the night we dined, there were many open tables around us...maybe some tables are saved for walk in's.

Food was very good...small portions, a bit pricey, but very good.  Lasagna was the best meal among all of our choices.

Great dining room ambience.

I got the lamb. It was very tasty. The polenta was eh. I felt  arancini were made with a white rice so they tasted a bit off. Charcuterie board is always amazing. The stars dishes of the night though were the duck confit risotto and steak. The risotto was cooked perfect and duck had so much flavor. The steak was cooked perfectly and also had a nice crust. We ordered the branzino. It was cooked well our only qualms with it was the side dish was a sort of caper/ spinach sauce and it was a placed in a side dish? It was very salty and just a bit awkward. Overall, well worth the wait. Ambiance A+, customer service A+, food B +.

"We had a table of 4 to celebrate my Bday and it was the perfect spot for it. The interior has a romantic design that sealed it off with a nice view on the dinning side. They were playing old school R&B which I wasn't expecting it but was fun to listen to while we sipped on the new fall drinks. The cider hot drink and old fashion were the winners! We all had pasta, entrees and free desserts (compliments by the chef) so we left SUuuuuper happy! Will def be coming back for the show this time!

"The Pink Door has always been on my list, now the opportunity. It was to be the wife, daughter, and myself, but daughter became ill. Tested negative.  The two of us took the BI ferry over for wife’s birthday. Took a cab to Pikes Market ($15+5) and then walked Post Alley so we would be sure to know where it was. Finally found it so we decided to wait there (45 min. early). She had a spiced apple cider (10.00). We got seated and ordered Arancini and a Ceaser salad. The Arancini was divine with the thick tomato based sauce with the warm Calabrio peppers (menu said spicy - no worries). She thought the salad was slightly underdressed but fresh and good. For dinner she had the Bolognese and I the Lasagna. Both were outstanding. I usually order the Bolognese as my benchmark meal for all restaurants, but fortunately for me I got the best of all worlds because I got to finish hers. Both were outstanding but if I had to choose I would order the Lasagna. Let’s not forget the bread. If it were bread and water and they served that bread I'd become a bank robber. Amaretto cheese cake for the birthday girl and the apple cinnamon caramel with vanilla gelato for me. Both exquisite. Our server KG was wonderful. Professional, friendly, gave perfect recommendations. We had reservation for 3:15. Seated 3:20. Left 5:23. Walked back to the ferry. Perfect for us as we got home at 8:05. The only thing we missed was the entertainment. Total bill under 150.00. Right around 200.00 with parking at ferry terminal, ferry tickets, cab, dinner. Well worth the wonderful experience. We will be back.

"I’ve had the pink door lasagna which was my fave, perfectly balanced red/ pesto sauce amongst green spinach layers & cheese, the meatballs are absolutely amazing..heavy seasoned with a slightly chunky marinara. The arancini balls are perfectly fried filled with a seasoned mozzarella sitting in an arrabiatta type sauce..The mashed potatoes! Omg the mascarpone greatest addition ever texturally and taste wise if you like a nutty sweet cheese hint. The squid ink tarttalle very good pasta Al denote, a seasoned breadcrumb mix atop a few huge prawns and cauliflower tossed in there..they’re bread and oil, legit sour doughy a bit but the oil with a tinge of lemon rounds everything out

"Booked a table a month prior - got up at midnight to do so - hopefully to be close to the live jazz session, however I suspect this is a marketing gimmick. The live music was in their front dining area. Our table was as far back into the rear dining area as possible out of sight of the jazz trio. Hard to hear any of the music - although piped - over the background babble. Tables were also quite close together. 

Food was mediocre, arrived fast. We were in and out in less than 1-1/2hrs. Great if you like to be hurried. The special scallop dish was a root dish, with caramelized onions and small bay scallops ‘mixed’ through. Not what we were expecting.

"I booked my reservation 30 days in advance (the furthest out you can book a reservation) to ensure my husband and I got a table for our anniversary. We got sat right away, but at a table in the middle of the restaurant, on a walking path and next to a booth with a noisy group. The server wished us a happy anniversary, so they knew it was a special and romantic occasion, thus the disappointment in the table choice. There was an available 2-top next to a window that would have been so much better and I should have asked to move, but didn't. 

The service was really wonderful and I could tell there were managers walking around to make sure everything was running smoothly. 

The appetizer was fantastic, but I was disappointed in my main dish. It was the squid ink pasta with shrimp and the pasta was good, but the shrimp was coated in some really salty, basic seasoning that didn't pair well with the pasta at all. Overall, just too salty and not fresh tasting. The house red wine was good. 

I was especially excited about the Jazz music, but it was playing in a different room than we were sat, so I didn't get to hear it.  We tried to sit at the bar after our dinner to enjoy the music, but there was a wait to be seated at the bar. 

Most of these issues could have been resolved with me specifically asking to be sat at a different table, one that could hear the jazz music, but I still think they should have chosen a better table for us. Also, the hostess was not very friendly. 

Loved the decor, ambiance, and service!  Shrimp and table choice could have been improved. Hope this is helpful to future diners!

"Even though I was only a party of 1, I received a requested window table with a lovely view. Maria was wonderful and made great suggestions for food and beverage. Had a half dozen oysters on the half shell with the balsamic ice (which were tiny, but the best I've ever had), and the almost requisite house spinach lasagna. The lasagna truly lived up to the hype. For dessert, my Whiskey Budino arrived with a birthday candle. It was just perfect, light and decadently rich at the same time. Glad I stayed up very late one night to make sure I got a reservation as soon as they opened up for that date.

"Our dishes ranged from outstanding (penne fumo), but served lukewarm to good (canary rockfish) so I am at a loss to explain why it is so difficult to get a reservation here. The food quality is variable and the noise is close to deafening so why book 30 days in advance? There are many other places with equally good kitchens but requiring far less effort to land a reservation.","Dined on October 13, 2022",4,4,4,2,the-pink-door,2022-10-13
"The Pink Door is nothing special. We got the Ahi Tuna appetizer which was good but didn’t have a lot of flavor. There aren’t just a ton of options as far as food. My husband had the lasagna which was just okay. We like meat sauce and it had none. I couldn’t decide on an entree so I had the three meatballs. They were good but definitely dry. I’m surprised that this is considered one of Seattle’s best restaurants!

"I would say it's a hype!!  I am not sure why people ranting and raving about this place, but I can truly say it is overrated and a tourist trap!  We heard and read reviews from Vlogers, TripAdvisor's, local eateries, etc., so we made reservation to be sure we get a table without waiting on a weekday.  It's only 5:30pm and there is a crowd with RSVP and walk-in.

Menu selection is mediocre at best.  I have dined at quite a few Italian restaurants in the major states throughout US on west coast and east coast and this is not even closed.  We ordered 3 dishes to try.  The linguine w/baby clams (in the shell) was too salty and not even served hot when the dish was placed on the table.  The risotto was very bland and not worthy of risotto.  The 3rd dish was the spinach lasagna and this was the only dish I would say it's good.  The pasta melt in your mouth with the right balance of sauce, cheese and pasta.   

Desert - Tiramisu is not on the list!! What kind of Italian does not serve Tiramisu?  

Wine list - We all know restaurant charges 3 to 4x the cost of a bottle but even that, the selection was not that great.  One would think in the Pacific Northwest, especially Washington, there would be many great options, but nope!  A $68 bottle tasted like table wine that is less than $15 from Costco.  They also have some of these gimmicky drinks that look nice, but I doubt it's worth it.  Which is why we settle for a bottom of red.

In short, I would recommend folks go to other Italian restaurants such as Blu Sardinia (Redmond) or Spinasse in the Capital Hills district.

"We had made reservations a month in advance. We were looking forward to our visit, especially for the live entertainment as we’d heard amazing things. We arrived 15 minutes early for our reservation. Our reso time came and went, and we were told we’d be seated shortly. No problem, it happens. When it was finally our turn to be seated, the hostess very quickly began leading us to our table. I tried to catch her attention by calling out to her once I realized she was taking us really far back into the restaurant. She either couldn’t hear us (most likely, as it was fairly noisy) or didn’t care to listen. I asked her if we could sit in what we now knew to the the ‘lounge’ as we had seen two 2 person tables cleaned and open when we walked by. She said that would be fine, lead us back to a table in the lounge. As she was about to offer one to us, another hostess was bringing a couple to the same table. The other hostess was quite rude and said no, I’ve already offered it to this couple (a couple who walked in mere minutes before we were to be seated; and online their lounge access states first come first serve). We asked about the second table, only to be told it was reserved for a large party coming in (website says they do not seat large parties between tables or groups over 6). It didn’t make any sense. We were offered another table near the back of the bar, which would give limited viewing of the entertainment. We wanted to see the entertainment, so we chose this over the back dining room, but then had to wait an additional 15 minutes to be seated. This was our biggest gripe - lack of communication between staff, and the fact that we had arrived early, been waiting a long time with no complaint, and felt brushed aside for others coming in after us. Our service from then on was just ok. Food was really good. When performances started, other patrons would move around, often standing directly in front of us. Staff seemed to encourage this. Overall experience ruined.
