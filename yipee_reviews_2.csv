"Absolutely the best Italian food I've had in Italy, with service and a fantastic table to go with it.  Having just spent 10 days in 3 cities across Italy, I really appreciated everything, and the hospitality that went with it.  Great pate, lasagna and daily fish.  Super wine list as well.  Looking forward to returning next trip to SEA.",Dined 1 day ago,5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"My mother and I accidentally stumbled into the pink door about a year or so ago. We smelled it and followed our noses.  Now we are hooked.. We try to go to The Pink door whenever we see a show in Seattle. It's not easy to get in unless you have a reservation but the food is amazing. Their Bolognese is perfection. From the pasta to the sauce it is what all other Bolognese strives to be.

We also got the gnocchi with gorgonzola cream sauce and pomegranate. It is rich but the tangy pomegranate cuts it just right. And the gnocchi is pillowy and light.

Service is friendly as always. Atmosphere has some strange elements when it comes to decor but even with some of the strangeness, it's still cozy overall.

I already have a reminder set to book our next reservation.",Dined 4 days ago,5,5,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The lasagna was amazing, but the Tuscan fries were disappointing … basically regular frozen fries with some large leaves on top and whole cloves of garlic sitting on the side (not presented in a way that you would eat it with the fries). The service was horrible. The hostess was extremely rude, and the rest of the staff seemed unhappy to be there and annoyed with having to help customers. The restaurant was cute inside but overall, I would not go there again. I would order the lasagna to-go if I could avoid the staff.",Dined 6 days ago,2,3,1,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"What a pleasant experience! We had the pappardelle bolognese, cioppino, and the Caesar. They were all delicious. We especially loved the cioppino which had a mild tomatoey taste not fishy perfect to our taste. I rarely order cioppino at seafood restaurants but was pleasantly surprised. Definitely will be back.","Dined on December 1, 2024",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"The Pink Door has always been special but in recent years it has risen to perfection.  Every time I am in town, I make a point to stop in and it is always a flavor sensation.  Every dish they prepare is a treat to your taste buds.

"Absolutely love this place. The atmosphere is very relaxed, the food and drinks are superb, so is the view and so is service (for the most part). I almost always order from the special or seasonal menu, and this time was no exception. Winter salad, scallops, special drink and espresso. The ingredients are simple but masterfully prepared. Sometimes difficult to get a reservation, so worth planning ahead. Highly recommend.","Dined on December 1, 2024",5,5,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"This was our first time at the Pink Door, one night I will never forget. From the moment we arrived the ambience made the experience feel classy. The decorations and lighting throughout fit the mood. Customer service and special request were  accommodated positively and without hesitation. The menu was simple but not lacking, wasn’t an overwhelming amount to decide nor was it too small to not have options. The food was made at a high level with attention to detail and exquisite taste. It is where I proposed to my now fiancé and provided a night I can’t forget and will be somewhere we come for our special days. Go to the pink door, you will not be disappointed.","Dined on November 24, 2024",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"We eat at The Pink Door at least once a month, and service is normally great. Last night, we had a server with no personality and would disappear and leave us frustrated. He never asked us if we wanted drinks or dessert. We had to flag him down to order, get our check. He never gave us his name when greeting us as if he lacked basic personal skills. The food was fabulous, so it was a bummer to have such a poor server especially since we had these reservations for a month to celebrate our daughter's return from college and my birthday.","Dined on November 24, 2024",4,5,1,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Service and atmosphere were great as usual.

Kale salad fantastic.

The meatballs quite terrible. Gummy quality. Over mixed. Not hit. A total disappointment.

The eggplant parmigiana sandwich was also worth a miss. It’s like ground up eggplant covered in cheese. The simple “teeny salad” was the saving grace, dressed simply in olive oil and vinegar.

Overall I wouldn’t rush back.","Dined on November 23, 2024",3,2,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Overall very good food, service and reasonably priced.  I gave it 4 stars because I don't give 5 stars unless it's outstanding.  The antipasto was good, but nothing special.  The bread was not particularly fresh.  I had the clam linguini which was heavy on the pancetta and too salty for me. 

 Had a butterscotch pudding dessert that was outstanding.

I would come again and try different dishes.","Dined on November 20, 2024",4,4,4,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Although the ambience was fun, the the food was delicious, and the service outstanding, the $33 (very small, 2 tbsp) addition of crab to my Caesar salad was NOT worth it.   In total it was a $51 salad. 

Now my son's $64 ribeye steak with wine reduction was memorable.  

However the crab addition is an unfortunate memory.","Dined on November 14, 2024",4,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The experience was  good. The service was not proper based on the experience. You should be allowed to enjoy some appetizers and drinks while waiting for you dinner to be brought out accordingly. BAD FORM!!  from serve staff.

"We’ve been going to Pink Door for years when visiting Seattle and loved it every time. This visit it was a disappointment and won’t go out of our way to return as we did in the past.

We were not impressed by the food or drink menu, normally there are great seasonal options and this time it was just a basic menu with a sprinkle of seafood specials.

We got the rigatoni and meatballs, the noodles were overcooked and the dish itself was bland. We also got the eggplant parmesan which was garlic noodle pasta with 2 slices of eggplant heavily breaded with a lot of cheese. You could not really taste the eggplant and was disappointing.

We left without dessert after being disappointed and waiting for our server to return numerous times for prolonged periods.

Overall, we were sad to have this experience as we always looked forward to Pink Door when visiting. The food used to be exciting and delicious and the service was always on point.","Dined on November 3, 2024",2,2,1,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The Pink Door has a reputation as a classic Seattle spot, but the hype did not match the experience. The food was nothing special and several of the dishes lacked flavor. On top of that, our server could not have been less interested in us. He had to be asked to do basic things like clear our table and order more drinks, and seemed bothered by our simple requests. A total let down and not worth the money. Apparently it has lost its luster.","Dined on November 2, 2024",1,1,1,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"I have eaten at many different establishments on both ends of the spectrum. Frankly pink door was a slight let down,my partner and I ordered 1 appetiser, 2 entrées and 2 drinks ( Did not get a dessert because nothing really caught our attention). Right off the bat the table layout in this restaurant was haphazard with tables anywhere they could stuff a table into. Service was not great either for example  our waitress waited for our table to be filled up with plates and bowls to the point we had to stack dish before clearing it.

The food was good but truthfully not worth the price (lasagna, fall special pumpkin ravioli,clam and mussels soup). And the the fall cocktails were most definitely not worth the price. All we tasted in our drinks was vodka and that’s it. 

Unfortunate let down.

Would we go back again? Probably not. Would we recommend folks to try it out for themselves? Probably.","Dined on November 2, 2024",3,3,3,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Perfect for a date night, dinner with friends and family.  Started with salads and seasonal soup, wife had pasta w/ marinara, a bright tomatoe and herb sauce with meatballs on the side, while I had the bolognaise, a decadently rich sauce.

The only con, was the host reacted and spoke to us as if there was potentially nothing they could do and as if the incorrect booking they had was my fault, and not a system error.

I was disappointed with the red wine that they served. It was Italian. The noise level was horrible. They really should not play music because nobody hears it and it increases the noise volume in the restaurant because everybody has to speak louder. I complained to This Server about the noise level. I've been there customer since they open 1981 I was there the first week they opened. My friends and I could not carry on a conversation because of the noise level. The food was good.

"It’s was our first time here. It’s a hidden gem because it’s actually HIDDEN but it’s worth the search. Reservation is highly encouraged since they can get busy really quick. They have a seasonal menu so the pics you may see on social media may not match the current menu. We ordered the special catch of the day: salmon with cherry tomatoes and broccolini, and the pappardelle with bolognese sauce. Both were delicious and savory. They were paired with the apple salad   Which complemented  and enhanced all the flavors. The o fly down side was the ciabatta bread was a little bit chewy and cold but we didn’t let that little issue ruin our evening. The decor is phenomenal and very entertaining with eclectic elements making Terence to different parts and times of Italy including the music. Service was very professional but can be perfectioned. We ended our evening with coffee and carrot-ginger torta which flavor was spectacular. It doesn’t have parking lot and it’s not ADA accesible. Overall it’s was an amazing evening with delicious meal so definitely coming back next time I visit Seattle! Well done!","Dined on October 9, 2024",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"We always wanted to visit but our days off are the days they are closed. We decided to get a reservation finally after seeing all the good reviews and TikTok’s. We had to wait 45 days to get the spot we wanted and patiently waited in anticipation. The anticipation was the only good thing we had about this visit. While we had a 5pm reservation we showed up at 440 and was told to wait at the bar as the dinning room was not ready yet and they would come get us. Bar tender was nice and drinks were good. As we waited we seen people behind us getting seated and finally at 520 we were seated in the middle of empty seating against a down stairway. Window seats open and other better seating was open but were stuck there and felt like an outcast. Server came and was nice but clearly didn’t know the menu was she kept looking at a note pad. Drink order placed and she left, came back with drinks 30 min later and asked if we made a decision. We ordered the salmon chefs special and pork chop. Waited another 30 min for food never checked on again and had empty glasses. Food came and was less then acceptable as we began tasting the food, pork chop was very good, greens were mushy and little baby potatoes were undercooked. Salmon was over cooked, what we thought were mashed potatoes were grainy and tasted like instant, the vegetable was unknown half burnt and soggy as well. Served came back 30’ish minutes later and asked if we were done. Took the 3/4 full plates as we said yes and she left, not asking if it was okay. First clue to ask was $80 in plates 1/4 eaten. Came back with a menu and said here are our deserts and quickly turned to the next table and started talking to them. Left and came back 15 minutes later asking if we wanted anything. We asked for check and was promptly brought to us. We paid and left not being asked anything or thanked for coming. Need less to say we will never be coming back and lots of friends have thought about going here but after our visit not sure.","Dined on October 2, 2024",2,1,1,2,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"This place is well-oiled machine. Service is efficient but that makes it a little impersonal. I sensed a vague annoyance that we weren't ready to order in a sequence that pleased our wait-person.
I had the audacity to ask if they needed to turn our table for the next round of patrons as we were feeling a little rushed.  And as I looked around probably about a third of the tables were cleared. So was this so folks without a reservation could be seated?  I booked months in advance and could only get a super early time slot, so maybe if I go again I'll just take a chance on a little later hour? Overall the food was generous and amazing , the combo of fresh crab with sweet corn seemed a little odd, but hands down was the almost the hit of the evening. tops for me was tied between the whole fish and my desert which was amazing, lemon peel with a marzipan was other-worldly. But no offer of a second cup of coffee we didn't feel encouraged to linger even as the room was clearing out. Another recommendation?  Ask for a table in the larger room with windows.  the first room is LOUD! And when the band started up I was grateful to be a room away. Will I go again?  Maybe, Le Pichet has better food, and Cafe Campagna has a quieter more relaxed ambience but the food needs  an update.","Dined on September 27, 2024",4,4,3,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

The Caprese Salad was a perfect starter with juicy and colorful tomatoes and a generous amount of mozzarella.  Our entrees included the Rigatoni with meatballs and the Pink Door Lasagna - both were flavorful and portioned appropriately. Our server was friendly and attentive throughout our meal.

We had a wonderful experience at Pink Door! The service was fantastic and the food delicious! There was jazz entertainment in the front room that was at the perfect decibel.

Hugely overrated. My tomato and olive oil European partner could not believe how much we paid for the quality of food we got. The “very good” olive oil we were served wouldn’t cut it to be on Mercadona shelves (maybe barely? but either way not restaurant quality). Bathrooms were cheaply decorated.

I thought it was located elsewhere in post alley But we found it very easily. This is a wonderful restaurant. It is very pretty inside as you walk through.  We went for lunch. We each had a drink, one with alcohol, one without. The Dicky and Hello Madame President (I can only hope). They were very good. My husband had the papparedelle bolognese which he enjoyed. I had a tiny taste, I have had better elsewhere but these n.w. seafood was just plain delicious. That halibut was beautiful. I wished I had more, even though the serving was not small. The sauce was great and the peppers were not spicy as I thought they would be. I would order that again any day. I really didn’t know what to have, several good looking things on the menu.

"The Pink Door is one of my favorite restaurants, period. The quality of the food, the ambiance, the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff and the overall experience are reliable top notch. This latest visit was no exception.

It's difficult to choose a favorite dish at The Pink Door because I've literally never had anything I didn't absolutely love. This time, we did the arancini as an appetizer and they were pure heaven. Crispy on the outside, filled with gooey cheese on the inside and topped with a Calabrian chili read sauce that was just the right kick to complement the creamy goodness. I opted for the pistachio cream trenne pasta which was an excellent balance of nuttiness and light creaminess. My partner did the lasagna, which is a Pink Door favorite for a reason. It's layers and layers of goodness. We skipped dessert this time but we saw a lot of people enjoying the grilled nectarine option, which looked amazing.

The Pink Door is simply one of Seattle's true dining gems. If you've never been there, go. If you have been, keep going. It's a great date night spot, fun for groups, and excellent when hosting out of town guests. You simply can't ever go wrong with this restaurant.","Dined on September 8, 2024",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

The sourdough bread and house-infused olive oil was soooooo good. Wish they sold the olive oil… it was drinkable delicious!  We ordered the rigatoni with mama’s meatballs and the lemon risotto with prawns. Both dishes were amazing!  Sat on the patio, our server was great, and we just loved the entire experience!

"We came to Seattle on vacation and before arriving asked around and did some research for the best places in town to eat. The Pink Door was recommended multiple times. Service was great, polite and fun. We started with the arancini and fig/goat cheese/prosciutto both were delicious. Entrees skirt steak, fantastic flavor, catch of the day, pan seared halibut was wonderful and the veggies cooked perfectly. Meatballs and rigatoni were a miss but we read good reviews previously, meatballs seemed tough and texture off for our liking. We had 7pm reservations on a Tuesday and we were seated around 725pm. 3 of us, bottle of prosecco, 1 beer, 2 apps, 3 entrees came close to $200.

"We have been to the Pink Door once 20 years ago. We live local so we are spoiled by being frequent visitors to the market. We came to celebrate my husband's 71st birthday. I requested a birthday dessert for him. They did not bring it. So disappointed. We were staying at the Inn at the Market and went to the Electric Light Orchestra concert after dinner. We purchased a dessert to go. As for dinner- the arancini was delicious. The Caesar salad needed a touch of horseradish and anchovy. The bread was dry, needed balsamic vinegar with the olive oil. The lemon risotto with prawns needed salt. It fell flat. Prawns were a bit undercooked. My husband had the halibut- it was overcooked and dry on a bed of lentils with some yellow grape tomatoes and sauce. Mediocre. Probably will never return. Not recognizing a 71st birthday is just not right. This restaurant could improve.","Dined on August 28, 2024",4,3,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Great choice.  Made reservations 30 days out and was very satisfied with our experience.  Service was professional and our waiter was informative and helpful with the menu.  Made our dinner enjoyable.  Food was really good.  Shishito peppers for appetizers was a hit at our table.  Everyone enjoyed their main dish and wine list has some really good items on it.

"We love eating at the Pink Door.  We've celebrated two anniversaries here.  The food is fresh, creative, and tasty.  The menu is expansive enough without being overwhelming.  We had the Alaska cod and Rigatoni with Meatballs.  Very flavorful and filling, without being heavy. So fresh!  The dessert of berry cobbler with gelato was buttery crisp and full of fruit.  My husband had the Lillet wine and I had the watermelon and rosewater lemonade.  Our waiter was just the right amount of helpful.  We live in the Napa Valley and when we travel to Seattle we make sure the Pink Door is on our agenda.  The only negative is that sometimes they are totally booked - they are that good!","Dined on August 21, 2024",5,5,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
We had a great time! Had out of town guest (Arizona) and they all liked their meals. Our server was great. She was familiar with the menu and answered all guests questions.

"Ate there on a Saturday afternoon.  The food was fair, nothing to drool over. We got the fries as an appetizer and they were good, warm, crispy and aromatic since they were friend with herbs. The eggplant Parmesan sandwich was solid. Meatball sub was very large and two adults shared it and were full afterwards. The service was terrible!!! Took forever to get our food, had to ask multiple times for refills on our drinks. We sat outside which made more a little more pleasant experience.  I think it’s overrated and the restaurant needs a rest to not be such a tourist attraction.","Dined on August 17, 2024",2,2,1,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Excellent food. Tender, fresh salads dressed expertly with herbs and best quality olive oil. Also, these people know their tomatoes. Superb. Pasta is handmade, delicious, although could do with a larger portion. Halibut special was solid. A bit overcooked for my taste but my dining partner thought it ideal. The carrot puree and basil puree that came with the dish were lick-worthy. Berry crisp was excellent, good balance of sweet and tart and crisp. Not too much ice cream on top, and the ice cream was good quality. Wine list had good selection with varied price points. Would go again for special meal, but it was expensive. For two people, two apps, two entrees, a bottle of wine ($65) and dessert, the meal came to $260.","Dined on August 11, 2024",5,5,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"Went for our anniversary and they were so lovely about it. Had cioppino and the torchio pasta.

Was amazed to see the length of the lineup but it moved quickly. Giant space and loved the patio area service was attentive. The bruschetta was great 4 servings of a slice of tomato on crusty bread with a delicious olive oil. The paradise was outstanding. The Congolese could have used a little more seasoning. The non-alcoholic Dicky was bitter and wouldn’t recommend. The berry crumble was a fantastic finish to lunch.

Service was absolutely horrible. Food was mediocre at best, their special was something out of a can with random cuts (chunks) of onion. Music was that of an 90s night club and loud.

While the food was delicious especially salmon and tranne, the service was lacking. When we showed our waitress the rock in the clam linguini, she did NOT apologize or do anything about it. It seemed this was not a surprise to her. Also, we were there to celebrate birthdays which was noted in the reservation but except the host wished us happy birthday the waitress did not acknowledge that at all. Overall, pink door is overrated, not worth revisiting.","Dined on August 3, 2024",3,4,1,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"When looking up places to eat in Seattle, this always comes up as highly recommended and sought after, so I knew we had to book it for during our Honeymoon!
The food and service were really great, but I was a little disappointed by the space itself. The indoor space was ok, but the terrace felt sandwiched between buildings with not much of a view, which I was really surprised about because people RAVE about the ambiance. 
Generally we liked it, but the outdoor space just felt a bit industrial for us.","Dined on July 27, 2024",4,5,5,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Absolutely fabulous dining experience at The Pink Door.  Great server Max!  The fig and goat cheese app and bruschetta were great starters and my guests all very much enjoyed their meals.

"As always the food at the Pink Door is amazing.  My wife ordered a glass of champagne and I had a glass of Syrah, portions were generous and price was fair.  We split the Tuna Curd which was very high quality, but I could do without the micro greens, but that is the big thing these days.  We both had our favorite Pink Door Lasagna and it was amazing as always.  The only issues we had was there was a hole in the floor board and my chair leg fell through it and I almost hit the deck, and we were too close to the table next door and the waiter could not serve that table without constantly bumping into me.  He did apologize, but they need to think about the layout.  We will be going back as the food is so Good!!","Dined on July 26, 2024",5,5,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Sadly, I waited too late to book dinner reservations, so we settled for lunch. We started with the GRILLED FIGS, PROSCIUTTO, GOAT CHEESE, it was simply amazing. My partner ordered the PAPPARDELLE AL RAGÙ BOLOGNESE and I thought he was crazy for getting something so ordinary, but I'm glad he didn't listen. It was the best bolognese we've had in ages. I had the fish of the day, which was Salmon and it was seasoned and cooked to perfection. 

The daytime ambiance was nice and breezy, but I hope to experience a dinner at The Pink Door on my next trip to WA.  The cocktails were a bit on the pricey side but very yummy!","Dined on July 24, 2024",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"My husband and I come every year for our anniversary when we are able. I always mark that this is for that event in the reservation, but it was not acknowledged on this visit. Why bother to ask on the reservation if it doesn’t mean anything?

The food was good as usual, but maybe not as good as it has been in past visits. They are top tier about refilling your water here though! 

I don’t know, it’s just our special place, and it’s sad that they don’t acknowledge the event. In years past we’ve gotten a glass of Prosecco, or even a simple “happy anniversary.” Sorry if I’m just sounding like a complainer. 

I also felt a little rushed out at the end by our waiter, but I understand that they’re busy.","Dined on July 21, 2024",3,4,3,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

The staff is wonderful, always an air of class, attentive, and making you feel at home. The food is to die for, making you want to come back for more, but enough to know, you need to wait, because it's that special. It's a treat. You don't indulge in treats.

had a lot of clams, which was great. The pappardelle al ragu bolognese seemed to lacked meat and it's supposed to be a meat sauce on the pasta. It was all noodles. We ordered the antipasto.

We wound though the restaurant and sat at a table with a beautiful view of the water. Our waitress was spunky and well informed. She helped lead us to some fantastic dishes which we shared. The Pink Door Lasagna was amazing and pair well with an order of meatballs. The Linguini Alle Vongole was excelent. We also ordered the Oysters on the half shell, and for dessert the Rhubarb and Donut holes (they both had better names but I don't recall them). Everything was just fantastic!

Drinks were spot on. Beautiful restaurant and perfect place to start our Seattle vacation. Hardest part was finding it! You simply can not go wrong with this restaurant . every dish was delicious and the staff are the best","Dined on May 17, 2024",1,1,1,1,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"This place is everything.  And it all starts with a mysterious pink door with no name.  We got there right before 1130 and the place was already garnering a line.  I thought all of us were going to rush the insides when the door opened.  And when it opened. What a delight.  Like opening a jewel box lid and seeing all the sun sparkled gilt and oil paintings and friendly staff.  The view in the back of the giant ferris wheel and the water is to die for.  And then to eat ... in those rooms .. with that view.. and the attentive, laid back staff.  The sweet/crisp/bright green/tender butterbean lettuce salad was so vibrant with flavor and greenness.  Butterbeans remind me of my grandmother.  And these were clearly from a nearby farm. The fish - grilled to perfection over a bed of crisped potatoes and greens.  The rhubarb pavlova - a tangy pink delight draped over a giant cloud of meringue.  A true slice of heaven.  Cant recommend enough!!  A favorite meal of a lifetime!","Dined on May 16, 2024",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"Fantastic experience!  Our server Ryan was the best.  If you dine there, must sit in the back with a view of the water.  All entre’s are very reasonably priced.  Will be back in June.

"This was my first time at he the Pink Door.  Not sure why I waited so long, it is a wonderful place with amazing food and outstanding service.  Had a table for two at the window, the view was spectacular at sunset.  We tried a little bit of everything on the dinner menu and it was all fantastic.  the tuna crudo melts in your mouth, the pasta course was cooked perfectly, the lamb chops were served rare and were crave worthy.  Also tried three of the deserts and they were all delicious.  Best dining experience in the Market area that I had had in a while, Well done Pink Door, keep it up, we will be back soon","Dined on May 16, 2024",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"I love the Pink Door. Celebrating Mother's Day with my daughter and her friend that just lost her Mother. Everything was great except our waiter. I had a gift card and also paid with my credit card. I made the mistake of my tipping on the credit card not the entire  amount because I was busy talking to the girls.  I am a very good tipper, he kept coming over asking about the service and when we left stared at me in a rude way. After we left I realized what I did, that still was did not a good reason for his rudeness.","Dined on May 12, 2024",5,5,2,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

I’ve been trying to get a reservation here for years (out of towner) I finally came for my birthday weekend with my husband and it did not disappoint.,"Dined on May 11, 2024",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"For all you go through to get a reservation, the food actually should’ve been better… The advertisers were great, but the entrées seem to be pedestrian… The linguine clam sauce was very dry and didn’t have much in the way of interest… The meatballs were excellent but we’re not served with enough sauce. They gave us maybe a tablespoon of sauce. I understand the Italians don’t use a lot of sauce, but this wasn’t enough sauce, the majority of the pasta was dry.
￼ the space is lovely and the service was excellent, but at the end of the day you go out to dinner for the food and I don’t think it added up","Dined on May 11, 2024",4,3,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The Pink Door never disappoints.  Great food, great service, great location.  If it your first time, I recommend starting with the Tuna Crudo appetizer, and then the Lasagna entree.

It is very hard to get a reservation.  I don't think I would go without a reservation simply because we are older and not up to the wait.

"I’ve been wanting to go to the Pink Door for years.  Finally, all the stars aligned.  It was a beautiful late spring day, and this restaurant”s outdoor space was the perfect place to be.  Abuzz with people, yet never felt put upon by a crowd.  Service was fantastic. The food was very good. The bill was high.  It made for a wonderful occasion that I look forward to doing again, tho not likely to be often (sigh).  Beautiful, unique and welcoming space on interesting Post Alley.

The light- filled dining room was beautiful even when we didn’t happen to be facing the view. Our server was gracious and attentive without being invasive, and the two birthday desserts were beautiful as well as scrumptious.

Most everything came out in a timely order, however towards the end our server forgot a couple of things so we were waiting around for those items and the check for a little longer than usual.

Fresh oysters, anti-pasta, prosecco, clams, mussels, fish, meatballs....we felt as if we were dining in Italy! We had children with us and they thoroughly enjoyed the experience as well.

Brava!","Dined on May 4, 2024",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"My husband & I had an early dinner at the pink Door and felt it was worth the hype. We sat in the back dining room with the windows overlooking the water. The noise level was significantly lower than the front room. The ambience is eclectic which unique wall art & a mix of textiles. Our table was fabulous- we were in the corner by the windows.
Our waitress was excellent. Very friendly, professional & knowledgeable. We had Caesar salad, PAPPARDELLE AL RAGÙ BOLOGNESE & fish of the day. The bolognese was excellent. The Caesar salad was just ok - nothing special. The fish was cooked beautifully but it was served on lentils which were just ok.   WeI would definitely come back.","Dined on May 3, 2024",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"Pink Door has been a Seattle favorite for decades; over the last few years, getting a reservation has been like getting an audience with the Pope. I understand that they have cut their reservations in order to ensure that they have room for walk-ins. I appreciate that. Just getting in is the biggest issue; otherwise, the food is terrific, the vibe has always been awesome, the service friendly...just great food in a casual, fun setting. Highly recommend if you can score a reservation, and probably worth the wait if you don't (they'll take your number, have you walk around Pike Place Market, and let you know when a table is opening up).","Dined on May 2, 2024",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

There is so much flavor and elegance in the offerings and so much understated class and gentility in the delivery, that you’ll want to stay long after your meal is done.

We observed other servers taking a small dessert with a candle to other guests and wishing them a happy birthday.  We were asking questions about the menu and he was obviously annoyed by that.  Sadly, the birthday girl in our group was so excited to eat here for her birthday dinner and we felt bad because while the food was amazing the service made us feel unwelcome and like we were inconveniencing our server by our mere presence.","Dined on April 14, 2024",4,5,1,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Rarely does a restaurant experience go so far above and beyond my expectations that I feel I have so much to write about every single part of the experience. We made a reservation for the pink door because we had heard it was a can’t miss Seattle experience. The novelty of seeing an aerial performance during dinner was the initial draw and it did not disappoint, but the service, food, and ambiance were also excellent. Our server Elyse took excellent care of us and took special care to find a wine that fit our taste. The roasted beet ravioli and artichoke pasta were both amazing and so different from anything we had eaten before. The ambiance was perfect for a romantic dinner. It was packed but we could still hear each other perfectly. We managed to see 3 of the 4 aerial performances for the evening and they were all stunning and unique. I cannot recommend this restaurant enough!","Dined on April 10, 2024",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

The middle of the room with a stellar view of the sunset and ferry boats going to and from. The service was outstanding. Very attentive but not intrusive. Perfect recommendations and handled our allergies with respect and care. Even the chef triple checked before sending our order to our table! Highly recommend this place. Bolognese, cioppino, mama’s meatballs, oysters, bottle of bubbles and lemon tart for dessert.","Dined on April 4, 2024",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"The Pink Door was a wonderful experience on every level. From the Hostess who greeted us, to the person who escorted us to our table, to our waiter, all staff were friendly, engaged and knowledgeable. Our food was delicious.  Noteworthy was the wonderfully fruity olive oil presented with the bread and the sauce that accompanied the Arancini. Main courses (cioppino, eggplant parmigiana, and halibut special) were very enjoyable. This experience was a birthday celebration (89th!) for a mobility-challenged friend and everyone—including fellow diners—were kind and accommodating.  We had a lovely booth with a great view of the Puget Sound and all the maritime activity. The restaurant has a very warm and welcoming ambiance. Looking forward to returning.","Dined on April 4, 2024",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

My friend and I shared the fig bruschetta over cocktails, then had some yummy pasta before our entrées. The chicken was delicious, and while I had hoped to have a salad before dessert, I was too full to indulge in both! It was my friend's first time at the Pink Door, but will certainly not be her last.

"My friend and I were visiting for the weekend and we loved our visit to the Pink Door! Unfortunately, we had some complications with our reservation time/date and the staff were so kind and accommodating to help us find a solution! They were very busy and managing a lot, and still made sure we got to enjoy dinner with them. THANK YOU! It was our last night in town and you made it lovely.

The ambiance is very enjoyable - good lighting, detail in the decor, and there is live music. We had a beautifully positioned table in the back room near the windows. I had the caesar salad as a started, Bolognese for my meal (the sauce and portion were perfect), and then we split the olive oil cake. Our server was fun and bubbly. We had a terrific time. The location is also fun, tucked in a cute alley near other bars and restaurants and not far from the iconic market.","Dined on February 17, 2024",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Outstanding.
Food, staff, service always amazing.
My go-to at Pink Door:  Caesar with fresh Dungeness crab, and the best darn meatball sandwich in Seattle.  Don't forget a couple tasty oysters for an app.
In our opinion, the best value and service of any restaurant in Seattle.
Skip the rest, and book here every month.
You won't be disappointed!","Dined on February 17, 2024",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The Pink Door is a favorite of ours in Seattle! We’ve celebrated special events, entertained colleagues, and enjoyed long, leisurely lunches with our of town friends - it’s the best. Great menu, atmosphere, views, service. Yesterday’s experience was sadly not the best as our server consistently and persistently tried to rush us through our meal and out the door.

We started with the La Fettunta, a simple yet divine grilled bread that perfectly complemented every dish by soaking up the rich, flavorful sauces.

But it wasn’t just the food that made our lunch great ; it was the overall experience. The blend of delicious cuisine, warm service, and unique entertainment in such a magical setting made our dinner at The Pink Door an outstanding adventure in dining.

"Reserved table through open table and requested window seats. We were sat in the inside room as there were no window seats available at that time. Before we could order, one table opened up. I requested the server, she asked the manager and the manager clearly didn’t even consider. We were told that we reserved a table for 2 and those are tables for 4. Fair. Then after 10 minutes I see 2 women seated there. WTF? Why were we rejected that table then?  Just felt wrong. Anyway, the food came. I ordered medium well lamb chops. Apparently if you want medium well chops, they will be burnt. The server tried her best. She changed and got my 2nd order. But I had to wait longer for food. Whenever I am here, I order their lamb chops and it was never this bad.  And the table thing felt like just mistreatment. Not worth the wait and the hype anymore it seems.","Dined on February 9, 2024",2,1,3,2,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

We had the usual pastas...pappadelli, rigatoni and meat balls with marinara sauce, which were all tasty, flavorful and delicious. Pici con sugo di coniglio was their special rabbit dish offered that day...happens to be my favorite of the evening. Order if you see it or ask the waiter for it. So Good! Short rib with soft polenta was well seasoned. Vegetable sides of string beans and brussel sprouts cooked just right.
Service was stellar...top notched! Dishes came at a good pace. Will be back when visiting Seattle.","Dined on February 7, 2024",5,5,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

I was able to book a lunch reservation at The Pink Door and loved every minute of it. My server was fantastic. She was super friendly and attentive and shared a lot of items on the menu that were her favorites. I ended up ordering fresh oysters that came with a tasty red peppercorn mignonette shaved ice. I then had the clams/mussels. The serving was very generous and the broth was out of this world. It came with a large piece of toasted bread for dipping and my server also brought me some additional bread as a back up. :)  It was a fantastic experience and I could have eaten there 3 to 4 times and still not have tried all of the dishes that I wanted to order. There is a reason The Pink Door is so popular!,"Dined on January 13, 2024",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"I was disappointed that my guest's 80th birthday didn't warrant a cupcake with a candle.  Plus, I asked for a quiet spot because it's difficult for me to hear in a noisy restaurant. Yes, we were seated by a window but next to a very loud party of four. We should have asked for the table in a corner and skipped the view. But we were delighted with the ambience, the attentive service, and the food. Also loved that we were allowed to stay and talk as long as we wished.","Dined on January 11, 2024",4,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Grown and sexy, without a doubt. Smooth jazz playing on that night. Both the front area, bar and back room, all offer thwir unique views and vibe. Ryan, our server, was exceptional! In a city filled with blah, nonchalant, dead eyed service, this place stands out.

"Overall my party of four was underwhelmed by our experience. The place is beautiful for sure. We were seated close to a window view of the water which is impressive as is the rest of the decor of the restaurant. However we felt our service was sporadic and less than expected. I had to go find our waitress 3 times for forgotten items and our check. It felt as if we were forgotten by the end of the dinner. Maybe our waitress had too many tables but our area was almost empty when we left. The food quality varied from good to so-so. We were informed the fish of the day was nixed due to the fisherman not being able to fish due to rough seas. I worked in the fishing industry and this seems like a made up excuse. Besides, your restaurant is next door to a major fish market! Also your website does not emphasize the need to be in the lounge to enjoy the entertainment when booking the reservation. This was not an issue for our visit since we had to dine early to make a different performance but I would have been disappointed if I had expected to experience this and been placed in the wrong area. Improve your website to inform your guests better ahead of time otherwise it seems deceptive. I will probably not dine here again due to all of these issues. Overall, disappointed.","Dined on December 29, 2023",3,3,2,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The food is quite delicious, the staff very attentive, and the ambience is fab. I also really liked their online place-saving offering. Super helpful!!! It helped us get a seat when they were fully booked!
I just wish they had the allergies listed on their menu though, as I felt like we were putting their staff on the spot with gluten and lactose questions. They seemed a bit lax with their answers, and I feel it would be much better for EVERYONE if the restaurant spelt out clearly what was what ON the menu!!! Please!!!","Dined on December 28, 2023",5,5,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

We came on time for our reservation and had to wait ~10mins to sit at our table which is fine.

"Not sure if it was the guests next to me or the server that bumped the table next to me, but I had hot candle wax spilled all over my pants and shirt. This was my first time dining here and I am not pleased with my experience. This incident ruined the rest of the time I was here. The servers just offered how to get the wax off my clothing, but never asked if I was okay or if I needed anything. Still paid full price for my meal which I’m thinking now if wax had gotten into my food. Not motivated to come back.","Dined on December 22, 2023",2,5,1,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"I have to start by saying that the overall experience was great. And has been great coming back to this beautiful gem in Seattle.

The place ambiance is unique. The food and the staff are amazing. My only feedback is to the host/hostess team, every time I have been to the Pink Door, I have never been treated well. Not even a reply to a “hello” or “good afternoon”.

I have to say that this is only specific to that area of the restaurant. The rest of the team is amazing, helpful, polite.","Dined on December 22, 2023",4,5,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

We made our visit to The Pink Door part of our annual Christmas dinner out - we’ve loved the food every time we’ve eaten there. The interior is very nice and we had a comfortable table in the back that wasn’t crowded. My only comment would be that the individual opening and initially serving our wine was so serious that he came across as unfriendly. Our waitress was nimble and took good care of us but I felt her friendliness was forced but get it - she’s extremely busy and the holidays must be tough in the restaurant business.,"Dined on December 21, 2023",4,4,4,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

She suggested the very best highlights of the menu and was even able to have them recreate an amazing off-menu squid ink pasta and prawn Calabrian chili dish that I got my very first time in. It was delightful because I had been thinking about that dish ever since that first time I had it a year ago.

If you’re ever in Seattle, make sure you get a reservation for The Pink Door. It’s beyond excellent in every way. Every bite of everything we ordered was exquisite.

We enjoyed our time. Our server was nice - I asked about the calm cool and collected cocktail which was on the menu on the website and was told no that’s not available. I would have liked her to check with the bartender or offer something similar but I was directed back to the seasonal cocktail menu. Understood why but it was strange to be told no without checking. The hostess was having an off night  - I know it’s high volume but she was a bit snippy with us and other guests and we saw her rolling her eyes walking back from seating someone. We had a reservation but got the table right in the walkway. We asked if there were other options but there were none.

"third time here. requested a booth when making our reservation, and we were seated in a nice corner booth near the window. server was great, the best we’ve had here, unfortunately didn’t get her name. arancini was fantastic as usual, along with our caesar with prawns. i got the chicken dish (cant remember name) with potatoes and green beans and it was really good, but nothing special. partner got the scallops (fish of the day) and they were amazing. i had the mistletoe cocktail and it was a nice sipper. partner got the pomegranate martini and luna rossa(?), both great but the second was def the winner. also got a half bottle of wine. total came out to 198 before tip. all in all great time can’t wait to come back","Dined on December 6, 2023",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Our mains were grilled lamb, juicy, perfectly done; cioppino, packed with seafood, slightly spicy; and pasta with meatballs, loved the sauce & pasta, but meatballs were kind of bland.

Wonderful hosts and ambiance. Interesting restaurant - very fun.  The halibut and linguine and clams were excellent.  Weakest link was the appetizers. Oysters tasted like sea water - not in a good way. Ahi crudo unfortunately had some white muscly pieces - ahi should melt in your mouth and not be chewy; other ingredients saved the dish.

"I’ve been to the Pink Door several times and this was not my favorite visit. I have been times when the food was amazing - this time it was okay. I should probably have stuck to Pink Door specialities, like the lasagna, but I ordered the special (braised beef cheeks with risotto) and it was underwhelming. The server was delightful, the restaurant was busy and noisy, and our 4 top was out in the middle of the room which lead to a less than perfect experience for conversation, etc.","Dined on November 18, 2023",4,4,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

The food is usually amazing, but this time the garlic bread was unusually dry and the BUCATINI ALL’ AMATRICIANA was really terrible. If the server had come back to check in and offered I would have gladly sent it back for a different tried and true dish. In the end she must have sensed I didn’t like it because when it came time to box up our food she said “do you even want this?” when she picked up my barely touched dish. Was also my friend’s birthday which we put in the reservation and that wasn’t even acknowledged until a passing remark as we were getting up to leave.","Dined on October 29, 2023",2,1,1,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Loved our visit. I was going to get a spot next to the entertainment but alas I must have booked the wrong seating area.
Nevertheless the entire place has a great ambience.
A little loud since there is nowhere for the sound to go, but tolerable for my sensitive ears.

Food is really good, I did need to add some salt.

My partner has celiac disease (can't have gluten at all, not even something that touched gluten).
The server was knowledgeable both about celiac (didn't need to be explained) as well as extremely familiar with the menu items and what they contain.

I've been to other restaurants in Seattle in the same price range and the whole experience at Pink Door was much better.","Dined on October 28, 2023",5,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"My girlfriend and I LOVE The Pink Door! We always come here every time we visit Seattle. This occasion happened to be for our 5-year anniversary. The hosts were so great, and they seated us at a nicely elevated table with a romantic candelabra. We were also lucky enough to see the aerialist performances during our meal, which made it even more exciting!

I cannot forget to mention the food. We had a nice Caesar salad, with the fish of the day (halibut filet and butternut squash purée on a bed of vegetables), the vegetable lasagna (to die for), and a side of grilled broccolini (extra charred but still soft enough to perfection). We cleaned our plates with great satisfaction and did not feel overly stuffed at the end.

Everything was absolutely perfect, and our date night was one that we will remember for the rest of our lives!","Dined on October 25, 2023",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The Pink Door is amazing.  I was in town for a large conference and talked it up to my friends.  We were able to get a last minute lunch reservation, and it did not disappoint.  We got appetizers, entrees, and dessert.  No one rushed us, and it was a 2 hour lunch!  The lasagna is their classic must order.  Someone got halibut that was PNW fresh.  Ciopppino was excellent.  Seasonal dessert of pumpkin bread pudding was also outstanding.  Even the guy who doesn’t like pumpkin said it was good.

"Food and ambiance were fantastic. Didn’t care for the waitress tbh. She clearly treated me different as a solo diner than the other tables around me, barely speaking to me while carrying on whole conversations with other tables which sucks when you’re spending as much if not more as everyone else. everyone should be treated the same. She also tossed my pasta leftovers then acted like I was crazy for asking why she threw away 1/2 my food. Mgr replaced the pasta which I appreciate but found it odd when he said it’s policy to toss food rather than ask the customer if they want it to go. If there were 2 bites that would make sense but literally 1/2 of my $25 pasta was left lol the foods too good to be throwing it away imo would definitely go back but would make sure to specify at the beginning I want my leftovers","Dined on October 11, 2023",4,5,2,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Pink door is one of my friend’s favorites so once we knew she was coming to town, we made a reservation to celebrate two birthdays.  The receptionist was less than welcoming and didn’t smile or act like she gave a rip.   
We told our waitress it was a special occasion (two birthdays) when we were seated.  The two appetizers we got were yummy - fancy rice balls and 1/2 of an antipasto.  The main courses were good but nothing to rave about - we ordered the clams, the pasta with meatballs and the autumn risotto.  
The autumn risotto just tasted like Parmesan cheese.  I was hoping for more butternut squash flavor and nice chunks of squash.  Pretty much puréed.  We had to ask for a dessert menu and the waitress acted like we needed to finish up so the table could be cleared.  No lingering over a nice meal and visiting.   I was disappointed that there wasn’t any recognition of the birthdays other than a half hearted ‘Happy Birthday’.    We decided to skip dessert and leave.  
On our other visits to pink door we have had good service.","Dined on October 4, 2023",4,4,3,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

I forgot his name but thank you so much for your excellent service last night. This is our first time here and Im glad I brought the whole family to celebrate with us. We ordered these foods/drinks:

2 Italian sodas (cherry/almond and almond)
Lemonade (this was so refreshing!)

Antipasto of the house-full (4 people shared this and 🤌🏼)

PINK DOOR CAESAR
The grilled chicken was so soft  🤤
LINGUINE ALLE  VONGOLE
 (baby clams w/ shell and pasta. I didnt try this because Im allergic to shellfish but my husband said this is 🤌🏼 too)
LASAGNA PINK DOOR
 ( I wanted to order 5 or this thats how good it is 🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼)
PAPPARDELLE AL RAGÙ BOLOGNESE
My least favorite but still taste good. I think my taste buds are so overwhelmed by the time Ive tried this that why. 
CIOPPINO PINK DOOR
If you love seafood and shellfish, this is the best as per my husband and in-laws.

My 3-year-old son also had linguine and red sauce with meatball and their TUSCAN FRIES & FRIED HERBS 🤌🏼

🤤THE BEST DESSERT EVER🤤
TOASTED ALMOND FLAVORED MOCHA AFFOGATO!

We will for sure come back and will try other food on their menu. I wanted to try them all last night 😅🤤","Dined on September 30, 2023",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Honestly, for the effort it took to get a table here, we expected a little bit more, but overall it was a good experience. The only issue we had, was a very spicy mixed drink, and our waitress did not let me know the drink would be spicy when I ordered it. I was more disappointed in missing the live entertainment that they are known for. The dishes were great. The drinks were okay.. but it felt more like any other nice restaurant we had been to. I wouldn't bother with the effort of staying up late and planning ahead to make another reservation. I think expectation just beat out reality on this one, but the food was delicious, so you can't ever be too upset with that 😁","Dined on September 29, 2023",4,5,3,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

When looking for the place, beware that it might a bit challenging to find because there are no outside signs or any kind of identification… just a Pink Door.

Food is amazing!
I had the Pink Door Lasagna… strongly recommended also the Basil Cake was really good!

Weather was nice so sat outside. Great experience!

Service was excellent! Staff is very kind and attentive.

Drinks, appetizers and entrees were all outstanding.  Service was impeccable, his timing was perfect, we were not rushed but he was there when we needed him.  

We ate in the main dining room, so did not catch the show which takes place in the lounge area.  That looks entertaining, but from the main dining room you have the amazing water view and sunset.  Different types of awesome!

The only thing that we were only very slightly disappointed with, were the dessert choices.  What we chose, to share as a table four (so full) was the basil cake which was good.  We’re all chocolate lovers, and so no options.

"Classic Italian fare done particularly well, in a - hmm, perhaps whimsical is the word I’m looking for to describe the setting. The Pink Door dishes are the most evocative of the taste and aroma of Italy of any place we’ve eaten recently, from the tasty meatballs and long-simmered sauce to the well-seasoned tagliata, preceded by a caprese and bruschetta - excellent, perfectly salted tomato on very slightly charred herbed/garlic toast, mmmm. The simple dishes are often the hardest to get right in a memorable way - and they do.  Excellent, friendly service with just enough attentiveness.","Dined on September 2, 2023",5,5,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"We had heard so much about The Pink Door. The service was good and the decor was quite sweet. Unfortunately our lunch did not meet the hype. Our caprese salad was pretty good.  That's pretty straightforward. My linguine alle vongole was tasteless (salty at best), and the pasta was overdone.  My dining partner's dish (fish) was equally tasteless. Maybe the chef had an off day or something.","Dined on August 30, 2023",3,2,3,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"This was a near perfect experience.  The ambience was so wonderful with gorgeous views.  The wait staff was incredibly hospitable and attentive.  The food was tremendous (pork chop, risotto, cioppino, chicken and steak were all amazing).  It was a fantastic evening.  The only challenge was in getting a reservation.  Reservations open up at 12:01 am 1 month in advance.  There are not many tables for 6.  The only time available was 5pm which was a bit early.  And I was on at midnight to do this.  I’m not sure there is anything the restaurant can do about it, but that was disappointing.

"We wanted to like this place more, but it unfortunately did not meet our expectations.  The view was nice from being seated in the back, however part of the reason we wanted to come to this restaurant was to see the acrobatic show, but there was no way to tell if it was happening or not. Disappointing. However, the food was good, but not great except for the bolognese- I would highly recommend the bolognese. So delicious! The service was okay - we weren't huge fans of our waitress, so it made the meal a little less enjoyable. I'd still recommend the restaurant to a friend, as I feel like it deserves a second chance.","Dined on August 20, 2023",4,4,3,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

We were shown to a very nice table in a corner by a window. Our server was very sweet and accommodating. We had been wandering and exploring around Pike Place so we were thirsty and hungry and excited to eat. The bread and olive oil … yum. Super hard to save room but we paced ourselves. Our antipasti was perfect. Gorgeous figs and surprising arancini. They make it with black rice! The caprese was perfect and the Caesar salad was well dressed if a tiny bit ruined by the need to use a fork and knife to eat it. I don’t know when restaurants decided not to tear lettuces into bite sized pieces anymore. Entrees next… my husband had the chicken parm which he said was delicious. My son went silent with appreciation as he ate the lasagna and only commented once to say he was glad we still had bread so he could sop up all the sauce. My risotto was tasty but very loose. Almost soupy. And some of the prawns were quite over. Our server gave us a complimentary dessert to make up for it and oh… those cherries poached in red wine and bay were so lovely. All in all we had a beautiful dinner. A very nice end to our vacation. Thank you Pink Door ☺️,"Dined on August 18, 2023",4,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

I think he needs a little training on how to open a bottle however. Didn’t cut the foil and broke the cork off midway. I would highly recommend seating in the lounge. Best view of the show.

Despite putting a tree nut allergy warning on the reservation and reminding the waiter that I had a tree nut allergy upon my arrival, I was still served a desert that had tree nuts in the sauce. I could tell the moment I took a bite. He was extremely apologetic and said the recipe has changed since they printed the menu, which did not reflect tree nuts. Given the hype of the restaurant, I would’ve expected better allergy practices. The price of the desert was removed from the bill, but I would’ve expected a larger compensation.","Dined on August 9, 2023",4,3,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Was underwhelmed by our experience at the Pink Door seeing as you need to make reservations quite a bit in advance. Food seemed a little pricey, had to ask the server for our complimentary bread 20+ minutes into being seated, and had someone else’s dessert brought to our table. They did try to make up for the mistake with sample size ice cream. Overall I would say it is fine, but not anything I’d recommend someone to out or their way to try.","Dined on August 2, 2023",4,4,3,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

We ate on the patio so it was quiet and we were able to easily carry on a conversation. All four of us ordered different items from the menu and we all thought our food was outstanding. The only disappointment was that their online wine list is out of date so the wine we really wanted wasn't available. Service was excellent with well trained staff. The fresh tomatoes were beyond wonderful. This is one of our most favorite restaurants. We had a reservation for 5pm that was made 30 days in advance.

They were able to accommodate us adding 1 person without any fuss.  Food was terrific, the service was all around great.  We ordered too much food because everything looked good.  Too bad there is construction nearby but not the restaurant's fault and it appeared they stop at noon for their lunch break.  I've already made future reservations since the place i so popular.","Dined on July 25, 2023",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
An interesting restaurant.  Appears to be a must-go when in Seattle.  Not sure I agree.  Service could be improved and being from New York - dishes may be a little different in Seattle.

I was reminded yesterday of why it has always been one of my favorite restaurants- the food above all (Caesar salad with Dungeness crab), but the staff, the setting combine to make it an excellent experience.

"We came to the pink door because it was highly recommended by several friends. I’m not sure why, but our experience was nothing like theirs. Inside was beautiful, but we did have to wait a while to be seated (despite reservations) and there was no where to sit while we waited. 

While my salad was good, my husband’s noodles were very undercooked and the meatballs were just ok. We needed to ask after our meals were brought to us if we could have bread too like all the other tables…. We also were not checked on often enough for us to bother with more drinks or dessert as we knew it’d be a long time before we got those too.

Was curious to see how it changed after not having been for over 10 years. The food was good but not great. The clam linguine was rather disappointing but the antipasto and the risotto were good. The service was attentive. The noise level was too loud and the scheduled band never played. All in all it was fine but would rather spend a little more money to get a much higher quality of meal and ambience at other Seattle Italian spots.,"Dined on July 7, 2023",4,4,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
BEST lasagna ever!  Excellent wait staff. Will return every trip to Seattle.,"Dined on July 7, 2023",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"This place only operates outdoor during lunch time, you will expect to be really hot under no shade outdoor. The food was normal, nothing special. My husband’s risotto had no taste, maybe chef forgot to put salt. Also, the restaurant is not stroller friendly. If you have a baby, you can’t carry stroller with you. You may park outside. If you bring stroller, the restaurant manager or host, who owns that place will annoy you.
As this place was known to many people, we decided to visit, but food has no taste, we were super hot under the hot weather with no shade. Server and host were not kind at all. We had unpleasant visit.","Dined on July 7, 2023",1,1,1,1,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"The cheese Board is a must.  Every restaurant I go to, which is often, I choose the cheese board.  This was the best ever.  Then choose the Risotto.

Out of town visiting and picked after some research. Get a reservation for the Pink Door. Food was amazing-especially the oysters and salmon!

to their guests. With a reservation secured, we were sat at a beautiful table right away.

We loved Pink Door and look forward to visiting again soon.","Dined on July 2, 2023",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"The Pink Door was definitely a highlight of our visit to Seattle. I was in Seattle with my daughter and her boyfriend celebrating her 21st birthday and literally, The Pink Door was amazing!  Not only was the food impeccable, but the ambience, atmosphere and service was top notch. Truly something that cannot be missed if you’re visiting Seattle. But be warned, you must make reservations several weeks in advance. It’s well worth the effort to get the reservation.

We had made a reservation for our anniversary. It was so loud inside we could’ve hear each other talk. They told us there wasn’t anything else available.

This was our first visit to the Pink Door for our 37th wedding anniversary and it was a win! Fortunately the weather was nice so we got to eat on the outdoor deck which had fabulous ambiance and nicely shaded with a trellis 'roof'. The server was very helpful and provided excellent service. The menu was great and difficult to make a decision so we'll have to return to try more entrees. We had the crostini  and 'Mamas' meatballs for appetizers. Both were awesome! My wife had the Bolognese and I had the Cioppino and they were also excellent. My wife had been wanting to try this restaurant for years (we don't live in the city) so it was perfect for our special occasion.

"Our standards for good service are the bare minimum: refill drinks as needed, ask us if we're doing okay, and don't rush us.
All 3 were lacking this time around. From the reviews, I was hoping for great service and an amazing experience, and we were honestly quite disappointed. Our server, (I won't say her name for her sake), was just not polite nor doing anything the right way. From spilling water everywhere, to grating cheese all over my friend's lap. The food was subpar, with the Lasagna Pink Door being a star. Unfortunately, I had no idea that Rigatoni and Meatballs meant having meatballs that couldnt even be cut. They were tough as rubber. Bread and olive oil was offered, but felt rather cheap and tacky. Overall, I hope that this place's service gets a revamp, as I felt that it was quite disappointing, since we had hoped for it to be a good experience. Probably not coming back.","Dined on June 21, 2023",3,3,1,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The Pink Door is definitely a vibe! The entry is obscure which lends to the nostalgia of this classic Seattle eatery. We enjoyed the atmosphere, which included a great selection of live music performed by a visiting New Orleans musician. Our server was lackluster to say the least. It was obvious she wasn’t loving her job and should have been addressed by management for her borderline rude demeanor. Our food was as described, hot, presented well, and portions were large. Unfortunately, taste and quality fell slightly short. Our selections felt like an elevated approach to tourist attraction fare. Overall, it’s a great environment. Manage your expectations for subpar service/mediocre food and you’ll be fine.","Dined on June 17, 2023",3,3,2,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

We made reservations 3 months in advance, and walk-in is that evening we’re shut down after and hour due to the long wait, so if able, plan ahead!
More of a Tuscan food experience and some authentic choices along with interesting additions! 
Overall very good experience…. We had the pasta with Ragu. The pasta was super delicate and cooked perfectly, the mean Ragu was very good, and in the true Italian way, they did not totally French the pasta in the sauce - Bravo!!
We also got the mixed seafood dish, all fresh  and cooked perfectly as well!!!","Dined on May 26, 2023",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Very nice restaurant to celebrate our anniversary. We were seated at one of the best tables with a lovely view of the Puget Sound without our request, probably because they noted that we were celebrating our anniversary.  Great service, attentive wait staff, delicious food, and the nice view all made this a memorable experience. The only negative was the noise level. Because the restaurant was completely booked, the noise level of all the happy patrons talking prevented us from hearing the nice live jazz music well. However, we much preferred sitting by the window rather than in view of the stage.","Dined on May 25, 2023",5,5,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Nice cozy restaurant. Caesar salad was refreshing and came with garlic bread. Our only complaint was the meatballs appetizer in marinara sauce was overcooked and dry.  Chicken parmigiana was crispy and cheesy goodness. Clam linguine had lots of clams. Rigatoni with mama's meatballs was awesome. A plate of grilled lamb chops was expensive. Cabaret cake was very good. Restaurant was very busy. We were entertained with live music as we ate that evening. Restaurant provided great service. Hostess greeted us right away.

"I hate reviewing things poorly but this was one of my worst dining experiences :( We were sat at a table that was in direct sun and squished. Our legs could not fit under the table. We were facing a rooftop with a loud humming AC to look at. It felt like a forgotten table you’d put an unexpected guest at. Definitely felt like oh maybe these two young people wouldn’t mind being here… but it was extremely uncomfortable. The food was not stand out. The lemonade did not state it would be pink, and the added sugar/flavor was overwhelming instead of refreshing. The bread was nice. Our waitress was nice. When you make a reservation a month in advance, I think you expect more, but this did not deliver.","Dined on April 30, 2023",1,2,3,1,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

I enjoyed a half dozen of the Fresh Northwest Oysters for an app, followed by Ravioli AI Piselli — each bite was more addicting than the last.

"Very elegant and classical atmosphere, unfortunately reservations for seeing live performances were booked up the butt a month in advance so lunch was all we had. Selection on menu wasn't exactly varied. Crostini ai funghi was cooked like taco meat and tasted like it too, with little to no mushroom flavor. My halibut was quite tasty however the bed on which it rested was lacking in volume, it only consisted of green beans and two large and bland potatoes. My dinner guest ordered the clam pasta and while the clam was flavorful it was simmered in far too much butter, an unfortunate trend that has spread across restaurants. It removes the flavor of the ocean from which it came, a quality that is supposed to be inherent in all seafood. Also our bread got delivered quite late, practically during our antipasti. Also it was cold. The fact that the food safety level in its window was just ""good"" was also very telling, in retrospect. Oh and that totally funny trend where places don't have signs out front? Totally helpful and chic. Not only was it in post alley but also it had a door that wasn't exactly pink pink, more of a very light salmon. That's just nitpicking tho. Overall, it was alright.","Dined on March 29, 2023",3,3,3,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"My wife and I stopped by, a little under dressed, for an afternoon bite to fill out our last day traveling in Seattle for the week. As a couple who have both previously served tables and bartended, this location hits all the marks. We tried the Crostini al funghi and Northwest fish to keep it light. Do your self a favor and try some of the wines. The Greco Di Tuffo hit all the right notes to pair with the halibut. Our server was very knowledgeable and attentive.

"Very nice restaurant for our adult family get together in Seattle.  Food is not foodie creative, but well prepared and tasty.  The back room facing the water was beautiful, had a warm glow to it befitting special occasion. Not too loud so we could have a good conversation.  Live jazz music was a nice touch.  A little on the pricey side but we’re visitors to Seattle and the cost was worth the experience.","Dined on March 25, 2023",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The Pink Door is more than just a restaurant – it's an experience. From the moment you walk in, you'll be transported to a whimsical and romantic world filled with delicious food, fantastic drinks, and live entertainment. Located in Seattle's Pike Place Market, The Pink Door has been a local favorite for over 35 years, and it's not hard to see why.

The restaurant itself is a charming space filled with twinkling lights, colorful decor, and vintage photos adorning the walls. But the real draw is the food - the menu features a mix of classic Italian dishes and Pacific Northwest seafood, all made with fresh, local ingredients. The handmade pasta dishes are a standout, as are the wood-fired pizzas.

But it's not just the food that makes The Pink Door special - it's the atmosphere. The restaurant is known for its live entertainment, including aerial performances, cabaret shows, and live music. The performers often move throughout the restaurant, adding to the already immersive experience.

The drinks are also top-notch, with an impressive selection of Italian wines, creative cocktails, and local craft beers. And the service is always friendly and attentive, making you feel like a welcomed guest in someone's home.","Dined on March 23, 2023",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"My husband and I were able to have a late lunch at this wonderful restaurant in Seattle. From the moment you enter   And greeted warmly to being seated by a window with a fabulous view we knew what a delight this experience was going to be. Our server Dan just could not have been more helpful as I have quite a food allergy. Our meals were well presented and delicious. Cudos to the Pink Door. We definitely return.

None of us had been there for years! well, we walked into the renovated larger dining room and the views were spectacular! the staff were super friendly and helpful and the food was so delicious...we had the cheese plate ...the lasagna, parpadelle pasta with rags and the pork panini all of them excellent....you will not be disappointed","Dined on March 23, 2023",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"I went early because my friends could not make it. They were busy, but the hostess found me a bar seat from which I could see the circus performer who was doing a ribbon-trapeze type act. I can't remember what the apparatus is called. Very talented, strong, and elegant!

The Pink Door ambiance is one thing I have always found classy and charming. The hostess, servers, were very helpful and attentive.

The ciopino was terrific, and the barman brought extra bread to sop up the broth. I have had similar dishes - this was very good - but it was not in my top 3 for a ciopino so I gave it 4 stars.

There a lot of other nice choices on the menu too, at a good value for the venue and quality of the food.

I highly recommend The Pink Door if you in Seattle - just expect that a place this good will be busy. It is in a really touristy area, so walk in service is touch and go.","Dined on March 22, 2023",5,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

We enjoyed the velvety Stevens Reserve Cabernet with mushroom crostini-so earthy, crunchy, and delicious! Then the citrus shaved fennel salad with blood orange and olives was bright and fresh. The pastas were sublime-the spinach lasagna and linguine with clams divine! Our only regret is we had no room for dessert!

"I've been here a few times and I really love coming here and I always bring someone with me. I was slightly disappointed because in Dungeness crab Caesar salad, I felt something very hard in my mouth and it was a crab shell. Then after that I felt another very sharp hard thing and it was an eggshell. Not ideal for a $30 salad, but they were kind and offered dessert even though not necessarily something I want to eat personally, but I accepted. I've never really had an issue before.","Dined on March 11, 2023",5,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Friends were in town for a convention and we were fortunate to get a reservation at The Pink Door. My husband and I both ordered the cioppino and it was amazing - fresh seafood, light tomato broth, with just a touch of spiciness. Others ordered pasta dishes, and the scallops - everyone was very happy with the entrees. Appetizers were a dozen oysters - fresh and delicious - and the antipasto plate, which was large, varied, and yummy. The House Red was OK, but single glasses of other wines, showed some excellent choices. Our server, Emily was great and other service staff were there when we needed them and did everything right. This is not a quiet restaurant, but in the back dining room the noise level was such that we could chat and hear each other. The atmosphere with soft lighting and windows overlooking the water was exceptional.","Dined on March 3, 2023",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Ambiance was both quiet and bustling — lively but easy conversation-level. Fine dining but comfortably casual (not sloppy, but relaxed) and unpretentious. Obviously a real treat, but also a great value, which is a rare combination. Basically, this place manages to be everything all at once, without overstretching in any direction.

"So it's been a while since we were here and since then they have expanded into a larger, less cozy restaurant.  It used to be quiet, kind of dark and a nice place for a special dinner.  Now it's a lot bigger and noisier.  The food is still good and my wife's scallops were excellent.  My meatballs were good but nothing exceptional.  Dessert was a disaster with a burned gingerbread pudding served that was not edible.  We also felt that we were being rushed by our server as she initially came by every couple of minutes just as we were trying to get settled and go through the menu.  I think it will be a while before we go back.","Dined on February 16, 2023",3,4,2,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Enjoyed our time here and the view. Make sure to book your reservation a few days in advance to get guaranteed a spot.

"I was recently attending a conference in Seattle.  I am a huge fan of Italian Food so prior to my trip I started my search for the most promising Italian restaurant.  The Pink Door consistently appeared in every search.  Because of the amazing reviews, I was not surprised with the challenges I faced trying to get a reservation.  I was determined and it paid off as I finally got a reservation online (it may be easier to call in).  My determination sure paid off because WOW, this place is amazing from walking up to this quirky building, the staff greeting my party, wait staff, ambiance and OMG...THE FOOD!  If overeating is a crime, then LOCK ME UP because I could not stop.  Every single entrée my party had was outstanding.  The ambiance was so on point that we just sat there after our meal was done because it was just that amazing.  GO HERE.","Dined on January 27, 2023",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Oh my, what a marvelous experience. From the near-hidden pink door entry to the classy decor, to the just-right attentiveness, and the no-rush pacing of our meal, I was smitten. And the food! I can’t imagine that any dish served here would be less than perfect, but here’s what we enjoyed: 

I started with the rosemary vodka gimlet and loved it. The tuna crudo was a complex and tasty combination of sweet and salty, and the portion size was ideal for two. The bread was crusty, lovely soaked in the olive oil, one of the best I’ve had in ages. At the suggestion of our server, I had the signature lasagna. Yummy! And not too heavy, and again, just the right portion size. 

We husband gushed over his linguine and clams. I begged for a taste and they were superb. We topped it off with the cranberry tart, not too sweet, and cappuccinos. 

Highly recommend and can’t wait to return.","Dined on January 22, 2023",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

I’ve been probably 5 times before and always got sat in the back so I count this as a win!). It was a little bit loud but the music was great! The server was kind of rushing us a bit with our orders, maybe to get our table turned, but other than that he was very nice. We got the Arancini and Garlic Bread to start (both MUSTA), the Paparadelle Bolognese, Linguine w/ Clams, and Squid Ink Tonarelli (Squid Ink was AMAZING) for our entrees, and the Cookies, Bread Pudding, and Coffee/Donut for dessert (the bread pudding was the most delicious think I’ve ever eaten).

Every morsel we’ve ever put between our lips, or sip we’ve swallowed, has been expertly crafted. We generally let the server lead us to their favorites, and they haven’t missed yet. (You must have the charred bread with whatever you order.) Tonight, there was a fantastic jazz trio performing, that topped of the experience.

We missed the summer menu… wanted to order the vine ripened tomato bruschetta on crostini… but they didn’t have it on the menu so we opted for the porcini mushroom on crostini tonight!  Super yummy!  We took the champagne pink peppercorn vinaigrette that came with our PNW Oyster on the half shell and drizzled it on the porcini mushroom and it gave the app a nice zingy tang!  Jon ordered his favorite Pink Door Lasagna as his main and I ordered the fish special which was three good sized scallops on top of polenta and a frisée salad. Dessert was a super yummy espresso jello like dessert with an ok maple bar. The Christmas cookies were also a delight!  Wonderful meal!","Dined on December 30, 2022",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

I had been been going here for over 20 years (I’m a Seattle original ;)) and it was always been amazing. I hadn’t been since before covid and the quality of food isn’t what it once was (or maybe we hit an off day). The papardelle noodles were cooked a little too long but the sauce was still amazing. The lasagna portion was smaller and barely had any bechamel sauce so the flavors weren’t the same. It was still good but definitely not the pink door I frequented for many years… the setting is great for the location and ambiance but I wouldn’t recommend to out of towners as a must visit place any longer.,"Dined on December 30, 2022",3,3,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

I got the lamb. It was very tasty. The polenta was eh. I felt  arancini were made with a white rice so they tasted a bit off. Charcuterie board is always amazing. The stars dishes of the night though were the duck confit risotto and steak. The risotto was cooked perfect and duck had so much flavor. The steak was cooked perfectly and also had a nice crust. We ordered the branzino. It was cooked well our only qualms with it was the side dish was a sort of caper/ spinach sauce and it was a placed in a side dish? It was very salty and just a bit awkward.

We came in to have desserts and drinks (we got 2 bottles of wine and a few whiskeys) to toast two of our birthdays and somehow the desserts (we had a 3 of them) were not as great as we’d hoped. We also felt a bit rushed as the restaurant was closing (our reservation was at 10pm on Saturday) We’ve had a great time always in the past but this time it felt average overall. Hope for a better experience in the future!,"Dined on December 10, 2022",3,3,3,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The Pink Door has always been on my list, now the opportunity. It was to be the wife, daughter, and myself, but daughter became ill. Tested negative.  The two of us took the BI ferry over for wife’s birthday. Took a cab to Pikes Market ($15+5) and then walked Post Alley so we would be sure to know where it was. Finally found it so we decided to wait there (45 min. early). She had a spiced apple cider (10.00). We got seated and ordered Arancini and a Ceaser salad. The Arancini was divine with the thick tomato based sauce with the warm Calabrio peppers (menu said spicy - no worries). She thought the salad was slightly underdressed but fresh and good. For dinner she had the Bolognese and I the Lasagna. Both were outstanding. I usually order the Bolognese as my benchmark meal for all restaurants, but fortunately for me I got the best of all worlds because I got to finish hers. Both were outstanding but if I had to choose I would order the Lasagna. Let’s not forget the bread. If it were bread and water and they served that bread I'd become a bank robber. Amaretto cheese cake for the birthday girl and the apple cinnamon caramel with vanilla gelato for me. Both exquisite. Our server KG was wonderful. Professional, friendly, gave perfect recommendations. We had reservation for 3:15. Seated 3:20. Left 5:23. Walked back to the ferry. Perfect for us as we got home at 8:05. The only thing we missed was the entertainment. Total bill under 150.00. Right around 200.00 with parking at ferry terminal, ferry tickets, cab, dinner. Well worth the wonderful experience. We will be back.","Dined on November 19, 2022",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"I’ve had the pink door lasagna which was my fave, perfectly balanced red/ pesto sauce amongst green spinach layers & cheese, the meatballs are absolutely amazing..heavy seasoned with a slightly chunky marinara. The arancini balls are perfectly fried filled with a seasoned mozzarella sitting in an arrabiatta type sauce..The mashed potatoes! Omg the mascarpone greatest addition ever texturally and taste wise if you like a nutty sweet cheese hint. The squid ink tarttalle very good pasta Al denote, a seasoned breadcrumb mix atop a few huge prawns and cauliflower tossed in there..they’re bread and oil, legit sour doughy a bit but the oil with a tinge of lemon rounds everything out","Dined on November 17, 2022",4,4,4,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Drinks were so so. Ambiance was there but to us it just isn’t anything special. The fact that reservations are booked up a month in advance, good for the restaurant.

"Booked a table a month prior - got up at midnight to do so - hopefully to be close to the live jazz session, however I suspect this is a marketing gimmick. The live music was in their front dining area. Our table was as far back into the rear dining area as possible out of sight of the jazz trio. Hard to hear any of the music - although piped - over the background babble. Tables were also quite close together. 

Food was mediocre, arrived fast. We were in and out in less than 1-1/2hrs. Great if you like to be hurried. The special scallop dish was a root dish, with caramelized onions and small bay scallops ‘mixed’ through. Not what we were expecting.","Dined on November 10, 2022",3,3,3,2,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Pink Door was a very nice dinner experience. We celebrated my friends birthday. We got the Arancini as an appetizer and was so good. My friend got the oysters and they were decent. We both ordered the lasagna. I was a bit skeptical since it didn’t have any meat but it was delicious so completely recommend. We both ordered drinks. I got the pink door mock tail and was too sweet for me could have done without it. My friend got pear vodka drink and was decent she could have done without it. We both tried their cheesecake but it was decent as well. Overall good experience.,"Dined on October 26, 2022",5,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"I booked my reservation 30 days in advance (the furthest out you can book a reservation) to ensure my husband and I got a table for our anniversary. We got sat right away, but at a table in the middle of the restaurant, on a walking path and next to a booth with a noisy group. The server wished us a happy anniversary, so they knew it was a special and romantic occasion, thus the disappointment in the table choice. There was an available 2-top next to a window that would have been so much better and I should have asked to move, but didn't. 

The service was really wonderful and I could tell there were managers walking around to make sure everything was running smoothly. 

The appetizer was fantastic, but I was disappointed in my main dish. It was the squid ink pasta with shrimp and the pasta was good, but the shrimp was coated in some really salty, basic seasoning that didn't pair well with the pasta at all. Overall, just too salty and not fresh tasting. The house red wine was good. 

I was especially excited about the Jazz music, but it was playing in a different room than we were sat, so I didn't get to hear it.  We tried to sit at the bar after our dinner to enjoy the music, but there was a wait to be seated at the bar. 

Most of these issues could have been resolved with me specifically asking to be sat at a different table, one that could hear the jazz music, but I still think they should have chosen a better table for us. Also, the hostess was not very friendly. 

Loved the decor, ambiance, and service!  Shrimp and table choice could have been improved. Hope this is helpful to future diners!","Dined on October 20, 2022",3,3,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Even though I was only a party of 1, I received a requested window table with a lovely view. Maria was wonderful and made great suggestions for food and beverage. Had a half dozen oysters on the half shell with the balsamic ice (which were tiny, but the best I've ever had), and the almost requisite house spinach lasagna. The lasagna truly lived up to the hype. For dessert, my Whiskey Budino arrived with a birthday candle. It was just perfect, light and decadently rich at the same time. Glad I stayed up very late one night to make sure I got a reservation as soon as they opened up for that date.","Dined on October 15, 2022",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

The Pink Door is nothing special. We got the Ahi Tuna appetizer which was good but didn’t have a lot of flavor. There aren’t just a ton of options as far as food.

"I would say it's a hype!!  I am not sure why people ranting and raving about this place, but I can truly say it is overrated and a tourist trap!  We heard and read reviews from Vlogers, TripAdvisor's, local eateries, etc., so we made reservation to be sure we get a table without waiting on a weekday.  It's only 5:30pm and there is a crowd with RSVP and walk-in.

Menu selection is mediocre at best.  I have dined at quite a few Italian restaurants in the major states throughout US on west coast and east coast and this is not even closed.  We ordered 3 dishes to try.  The linguine w/baby clams (in the shell) was too salty and not even served hot when the dish was placed on the table.  The risotto was very bland and not worthy of risotto.  The 3rd dish was the spinach lasagna and this was the only dish I would say it's good.  The pasta melt in your mouth with the right balance of sauce, cheese and pasta.   

Desert - Tiramisu is not on the list!! What kind of Italian does not serve Tiramisu?  

Wine list - We all know restaurant charges 3 to 4x the cost of a bottle but even that, the selection was not that great.  One would think in the Pacific Northwest, especially Washington, there would be many great options, but nope!  A $68 bottle tasted like table wine that is less than $15 from Costco.  They also have some of these gimmicky drinks that look nice, but I doubt it's worth it.  Which is why we settle for a bottom of red.

In short, I would recommend folks go to other Italian restaurants such as Blu Sardinia (Redmond) or Spinasse in the Capital Hills district.","Dined on October 12, 2022",3,3,3,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"We had made reservations a month in advance. We were looking forward to our visit, especially for the live entertainment as we’d heard amazing things. We arrived 15 minutes early for our reservation. Our reso time came and went, and we were told we’d be seated shortly. No problem, it happens. When it was finally our turn to be seated, the hostess very quickly began leading us to our table. I tried to catch her attention by calling out to her once I realized she was taking us really far back into the restaurant. She either couldn’t hear us (most likely, as it was fairly noisy) or didn’t care to listen. I asked her if we could sit in what we now knew to the the ‘lounge’ as we had seen two 2 person tables cleaned and open when we walked by. She said that would be fine, lead us back to a table in the lounge. As she was about to offer one to us, another hostess was bringing a couple to the same table. The other hostess was quite rude and said no, I’ve already offered it to this couple (a couple who walked in mere minutes before we were to be seated; and online their lounge access states first come first serve). We asked about the second table, only to be told it was reserved for a large party coming in (website says they do not seat large parties between tables or groups over 6). It didn’t make any sense. We were offered another table near the back of the bar, which would give limited viewing of the entertainment. We wanted to see the entertainment, so we chose this over the back dining room, but then had to wait an additional 15 minutes to be seated. This was our biggest gripe - lack of communication between staff, and the fact that we had arrived early, been waiting a long time with no complaint, and felt brushed aside for others coming in after us. Our service from then on was just ok. Food was really good. When performances started, other patrons would move around, often standing directly in front of us. Staff seemed to encourage this. Overall experience ruined.","Dined on October 5, 2022",3,4,2,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Eclectic atmosphere, very, very crowded, uncomfortable to make your way through, seated on top of one another and food that for the most part was just acceptably good,  nothing special, felt too busy, the waiter was wonderful but then forgot to give us silverware after our food was served.

"Have always loved TPD. It’s still amazing, but I think our orders were off tonight. The fig starter is A+. But the mains were good not great tonight. 

The risotto was 8/10. Nice, I was happy, but it wasn’t as robust as TPD usually is. Not overpowering, but flavorful. Same for the fish special—salmon. 

We will be back, and it certainly wasn’t bad. It was a good experience, just not amazing as We come to expect. 

With that said, Dylan, our server, ambiance, and experience were fantastic.

"We were excited and hopeful for our meal with The Pink Door but we're disappointed. 

Upon being seated in their outdoor patio section we were immediately uncomfortable because of the heat, the patio is located between two buildings so there is no breeze and the restaurant does not have any fans. The lattice roof does not do enough to provide shade and the patio was full so the crowd didn't help either. The cutlery and water glasses were dirty at our table as well which was disappointing.

The food was fair but the heat made the meal difficult to enjoy and it wasn't as good as we had expected based on the reviews. 

Highly recommend making adjustments to the patio for hotter days, IE, fans or limited seating. That was the real issue with our experience.","Dined on August 31, 2022",1,2,2,1,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

My all-time favorite in the summer is the heirloom Caprese salad. So delicious!  Bread and excellent olive oil started our meal.  We extended our stay with a cup of excellent coffee.

"This is the 5th or 6th time I have dined at the Pink Door and am happy to report that the place is still ""fine dining"" in downtown Seattle. This is 1 of my favorite restaurants in Seattle and we shall return. The only 2 issues that arose were: 1) the owner will not let staff serve butter - you get olive oil (like it or not). I love olive oil with my bread but my wife prefers butter; no big deal; that's the prerogative of the owner but I feel that if a patron wants something (i.e. ketchup with his / her filet mignon) - they should get it - no questions asked or faces made. 

2) the cioppino my wife had was very good but was a bit lite on the fish and shell fish (at least 3 mussels were shells only and the small piece of Rock Fish was - well........small!). But to give credit where credit is due, they simply took that off our bill (but with no apology). We would have gladly settled for a very small additional serving and would have been happy to pay. 

The ambience is very pleasant and the service was very good. The restaurant was full by the time we left (mostly tourists I suspect) so they are nit hurting for business. Book in advance!","Dined on August 23, 2022",4,4,4,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"I have been frequenting The Pink Door since the mid 1980s and was delighted to return for the first time in a long while to find that the quality of food, service and overall experience remain top-notch.  Really among the top restaurants in Seattle. They have a lovely outdoor area which is a must-do on sunny days.  During the evenings there is usually some interesting performance happening on a small stage.","Dined on August 23, 2022",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"Pink door is a Seattle classic and does not disappoint when it comes to food!!! Cheese board was the bomb!! The best lasagna I’ve ever eaten. Also the meatballs were so good. We were also lucky to get a reservation when the performance was happening so loved watching the trapeze artist!
We were really hoping to get the tiramisu but it was not on the menu for the summer.","Dined on August 21, 2022",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
The food and atmosphere were outstanding.  We sat in the bar area next to the outdoor seating exit door(not the best table).  I would not recommend this table because there was a lot of traffic and also people coming in from outside to see the show. The people coming in stood in front of you and blocked your view of the show.  I will have to say a staff member tried her best to keep this area clear during the show but it got a little crowded.  So if I had to do it over again I would  try and get a good table outside or in the main dining room and walk up to see the show like everyone else. The food was OUTSTANDING!  I would highly recommend putting The Pink Door on your list to eat at if your are in Seattle.,"Dined on August 21, 2022",5,5,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"I was really excited for this restaurant, but I think it fell a little short of what I was expecting.  The basil lemonade drink I had tasted weirdly super salty and the risotto was also pretty salty.  The saving grace was the Amaretto cheesecake.  I think for how hard it was to get a reservation to the prices, I just expected more.","Dined on August 21, 2022",3,3,4,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"As always Pink Door exceeded my expectations.  Thank you for the lovely table on the deck.  Our wait person was cordial & personable.  She was wearing the perfect orange dress with flowers - so PINK DOOR! Sadly I had to hear her deal with the idiot at the adjoining table who was sooo put out because he couldn’t order a beer “on tap” - apparently, the system was down, but he just couldn’t bring himself to order one of  your bottled beers.  Meanwhile, the table to my right, brought their sweet guide dog … after giving their 4 top waters she made sure the big lab (who tucked in seamlessly under the table) was accommodated with a bowl of water.  Thankfully, the beer deprived diner was in & out in just 45 minutes.  Our lunch was delicious & everyone on your staff is ever so patient - from the front of the house - to the wait staff - as  the hoards descend on the terrace on a sunny day.  Jackie, if you’re still at the helm congratulations! I’ve been coming to your place for over 25 years & it’s the best! Sorry, for going long.

"Was in Seattle for a night for a girls weekend. This restaurant had great reviews. Food was fine but nothing special. There are only two vegetarian options and we tried both. The burrata pasta with tomatoes was good but simple (i.e. can make at home) and the portion was small. The service wasn't great, we had to pour our own wine (which is fine but speaks to the caliber of the service). I had to ask a few times for more dipping oil - wasn't sure if the waitress couldn't hear me or wasn't listening. We were intrigued by the live entertainment but the trapeze artist performed once every 30 minutes or so for a few minutes, so hard to catch it as were sitting outside. Was yelled at by a bartender for taking a photo, though no one said when we arrived not to take photos!  The dessert was awful - we had the basil raspberry cake and it was dense, small, and not that tasty. Wondering if it was a bad batch because the cake itself didn't have great texture. The alley where the restaurant is located is beautiful and was cool to discover it but wouldn't go back to this spot.","Dined on August 14, 2022",3,3,2,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Made a reservation the day of (a Tuesday night) and was able to get a table in the main dining room (the lounge was fully booked and goes quickly and early). Waitress was attentive and kind.

"Beautiful restaurant. Comfortable yet elegant decor just a half block up from Pike’s Place Market. Food was excellent. I highly recommend The Pink Door lasagna. It’s vegetarian and oh so delicious with thinner lasagna noodles and three different sauces that blend so well together. It’s amazing. I went with a girlfriend and her two daughters. They ordered chicken saltimboca, shrimp Caesar salad, and spaghetti and meatballs, with a side of corn with Calabrian chiles. Only little thing was the shrimp were a bit dry because they were overcooked. Definitely go and try this Italian restaurant if you get a chance.","Dined on August 3, 2022",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Reservation for Thursday lunch was necessary for this popular Pike Place Market spot, especially to sit outside as we desired. With outdoor dining being weather-dependent, we didn’t realize the hot weather would limit outdoor seating. We had to wait to be allowed to sit outside, but the quieter sound level and Covid-safety was worthwhile.  The food was tasty as expected for our day prior to our wedding anniversary celebration.  Clams and mussels were served in a tasty broth, enjoyed with the crusty bread to soak up the extra.  Fusilloni Gigante was a great summer option with ripe tomatoes, fresh herbs, and burrata on top to mix in.  Great decision to order the basil cake with raspberry jam filling for take out to enjoy later!","Dined on July 28, 2022",4,5,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
They stayed live music but didn’t tell you it doesn’t start til 7 and when we left at 730 it still hadn’t started. We felt very rushed they were more interested in turning tables than service.

"The Pink Door remains my favorite restaurant in Seattle. Granted, it brings back fond memories of my Seattle upbringing and going regularly back in the 80s in its early days of being quirky and fabulous. It’s still that and so much more.

The food was delicious. They do have a gluten free pasta that can be substituted in some of their dishes. The antipasto was really good. They offer gluten free bread, which is basically sliced sandwich bread that is cut on the diagonal and buttered. You get 8 of these half slices. Not the best option, but I wanted bread to eat with my Italian food and wine. Everything else we ate was so good, I will definitely make reservations again for our next visit to Seattle.","Dined on July 13, 2022",5,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

We went here for a special occasion and The Pink Door did not disappoint - everything we ate and drank was incredible - from the cocktails, to our house appetizer (and delicious bread + olive oil, hints of rosemary? YES PLEASE) , to pasta & pork chops, to tiramisu and a tart. Our server was super bubbly and attentive - I wish I caught their name, they were fabulous.

"Great Italian food with a view and very reasonable prices!  A must when in Seattle.
The food was amazing....the tuna crudo, lasagna, cioppino, and clams linguine.  The portion sizes was good (not huge portions) but enough to satisfy and leaving you fairly full.  Their complimentary bread and homemade infused olive oil were also delicious!   We were full so we did not have the opportunity to try their desserts. They also had some signature cocktails....so delish!    I would have to admit that this is the best Italian meal that I have anywhere in the U.S.  I wished they have an Italian restaurant as good where I live.  A very enjoyable meal with great service and a great view but with reasonable prices!  I will definitely be back when in Seattle.","Dined on June 23, 2022",5,5,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Pink Door was very good. We came for dinner in June 2022. For starters, we got the arancini which was very rich, but very good. The fry was perfect and it didn't eat greasy at all. The parmesan sauce was also very good. Next we split the Caesar salad which was really good, particularly the fennel croutons. For entrees, we had the bolognese and the lamb chops, which we both really liked. The lamb chops were well seasoned and the accompaniments (olives, artichokes, ricotta gnocchi) were perfect. Surprised this isn't a more popular menu item. Overall, a great experience.","Dined on June 16, 2022",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Service and ambiance were outstanding. My son ordered the honey lavender pudding with lemon cake and said it was the best dessert he has ever had. His friend ordered the tiramisu and that was amazing, as well. The lasagna had a lot of pesto, which I liked, but others may not, so heads up on that. And my son had the flank steak, which the thought was great, but the sides had a chili-sauce on them that made them too spicy for his taste. His friend ordered pasta with meatballs. He liked the pasta, but said he thought the meatballs had mint in them, which he didn’t love.

The very first problem is the smell of the place when entering, I don’t know if it is always like this, but there was a not pleasant strong smell. The place is nice overall and the service was good. Regarding the food, the arancini were good, but the risotto and the lamb were really heavy. I personally got the lamb and my wife the risotto.

"My wife and I ordered two of the specials from the menu, a salmon dish and a pork chop dish. The salmon was way overcooked and dry as a bone. The accompanying vegetables, green peas, asparagus and morel mushrooms, were very good. The pork chop was slightly overcooked, but the fennel seeds on the chop dominated the flavor profile. The fennel seeds were not mentioned as being part of the dish. Cocktails were decent. My drink had a kiwi puree that was tasty, but the black seeds were not strained from the puree, leaving an ugly black sediment at the bottom of the glass.

Too dense and sauce tasred like jar of Bertolis. The Ceasars a miss as croutons were tasteless. Fennel dusted?  Hits were the bread and VOO.

"Everything was wonderful at the restaurant. My husband and I dined here three years ago while in Seattle and just had to return.

Our dining experience was better than perfect. Our server, Lexie, was AMAZING and should be commended for the superior service we received. The decor was unique and our food was so delicious. Both my husband and I ordered their specialty, the bolognese, which was the BEST we have ever had, anywhere. The dish, which had the most luscious meat sauce and wide homemade noodles, melted in our mouths. 

When in Seattle, this is a restaurant you should not miss. You will LOVE it! You have to go up a street across from Pike's Market (Post Alley?) and look for a metal pink door. There isn't a sign outside with the restaurant's name on it; you just have to know where it is. If you can't find it, ask a resident. Also, make your reservation at least a few weeks in advance. The place is always packed to the hilt. The prices are somewhat high, but believe me, what you pay is worth every penny.","Dined on May 19, 2022",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Our waitress was training someone, she was friendly however we had to ask for water several times, we ordered a drink and entree.  The tables are very close to one another and our glasses were at the end of the table empty- pretty obvious.. The portions have definitely gotten smaller.

"This is a beautiful restaurant with wonderful food. I refrained from a five star rating because my beet ravioli entree was a very small and had no accompanying side whatsoever.  The size of the entrées of my guests were much more appropriate.

"I was visiting from out of town and wanted to take my friend who lives here out for his birthday. Safe to say neither of us have had a meal in our lives that was as carefully crafted, detailed, or made with love as much as the food at the Pink Door. After each bite we were looking at each other in disbelief… this little hidden gem was bursting with exquisite flavor! Not only was the food amazing, but the aerial artist performed shortly after we were seated and everyone was blown away. Our waiter Ryan took the time to explain the menu and make the perfect suggestions for us throughout our night. Everything from the cocktails and appetizers all the way to the last bite of the dessert had complexities that he explained to us and they made the meal even more special. We tried to guess how much our bill was before it came and both of us actually guessed too high! The value is outstanding for the quality of food, service, and ambiance. You are getting this experience for a steal in our opinion. Will 100% be returning the next time I’m in Seattle!","Dined on April 20, 2022",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

 Only thing that I didn’t like was when I made the reservation the open table website said dress smart casual and when I called that’s how they explained it and when we showed up, we  were a little overdressed while everybody was wearing T-shirt and jeans.

"We made a reservation via open door. I was looking forward to see the aerodynamic show but unfortunately, the show is only at the lounge. We got seated in the back of the restaurant, and the view compensated not been able to watch the show. 

We ordered a few anti pastas and entres. I would say the food is ok but I’ve had better pasta. The carbonara was very salty :( The only pasta we liked was the linguine. 

This place definitely has a great atmosphere for drinks and an amazing view to the fairs wheel and ocean. However, I don’t think the entres were to excellence compared to other restaurants in town.

"Liked the overall feel of the place. Portions are not large so recommend an appetizer not just an entree, but the food was good. The view is great- however, if you want a window seat for 2 you should request one specifically when you make your reservation, otherwise they keep them “for their regulars who are in the know”. I made my reservation 6 weeks in advance for 5pm - there were several open tables when we were being seated. I asked if we could get one and that’s what I was told by the manager. Nice guy but still kind of a frustrating response. 
Biggest issue of the night, by far, was the service. Our waitress was SO bad. We had to ask 2 servers who were NOT ours for things because she was nowhere to be found for large stretches of time. I think she was at our table for drink orders and food orders, 1 time after we got our food and to finally bring the check over (which we had to ask another waiter to get for us because we were just sitting there waiting.) Someone else dropped off our meals, she never checked to see if everything was correct or if we needed anything else until we were almost finished. We needed more bread for a dish that specifically needed bread… had to find another server. Even after someone else had brought our check, my husband had to go find her to tell her the card needed to be run because we had an event to get to soon. I watched her walk over to a table near ours and stand and chat with the people for quite awhile before she finally came over. 
All in all, I really liked the overall setup of the place and vibe and the food was good. Just the seating and the service kind of put a dampening on our first impression.","Dined on April 2, 2022",4,4,2,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

This was the second time going to restaurant and was awesome both times.  My son lives in Seattle area and plans to come back to the restaurant now that he knows where it is.

Food is nicely done - although not overly memorable.  In our party of 4, we had the Caesar salad with prawns, the mussels and clams and the chaucurterie plate.  All were beautiful presented.  Flavors were good.  We would return and would consider this a nice restaurant for special  occasions.","Dined on March 30, 2022",5,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Server we had tonight was really kind and personable. The host, up front, wearing a green turtle neck and was a young AA female, was very very cold/rude upon arrival. 

We were told we would be seated by the live music, as I called ahead of time, but we were not seated in the lounge. Not enough to raise a complaint but we thought that was odd.","Dined on March 27, 2022",4,4,5,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"First time in Seattle and heard about this place so had to try it. We enjoyed the ambience, but did not enjoy where we were seated. We were placed on a stage above the rest of the restaurant felt like others could see us eating which is not comfortable. Also the table was so small it barely could hold the bread basket and the dipping plates and water. Felt like if I moved I might knock something over and it fall on the ppl sitting below us. The food was good, but nothing amazing. The rib eye we ordered was very charred, and the pasta bowl was mostly just shells not very much pasta. The cocktails were tasty and we loved the live performance. Nice touch to a Saturday night date.","Dined on March 6, 2022",3,3,3,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The pink door was definitely one of a kind. From the exterior pink door to their seasonal menu. The noise level was pretty loud inside making it difficult to hear the person across from me and our server. We started with mushroom crostini and we felt the dish was overall very oily and messy to eat. Flavors were great and very delish. We had the risotto and fish of the day for our entree. Fish dish - overall great dish but very acidic from the vinaigrette. Risotto - overall also great, but radicchio made the dish bitter and sausage pieces were too big - inconsistent with rice. For dessert we had ricotta donuts and an affogato (off menu) which were both AMAZING. The grapefruit jelly with the donuts was to die for, I wish we could have take some home with us. The affogato was a nice touch at the end of the meal. Thanks for having us!","Dined on March 3, 2022",4,4,3,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Visiting from out of town, this was our first time at Pink Door. The food was excellent! Some factors driving my lower rating included a very long wait to get our food. We had a 7:45 pm reservation on a Tuesday, so at the time we got there, the rush was dissipating. There were three of us, and we were seated at a table for two, so it was very cramped. Also, although our waitress was very friendly and professional, she only checked on our table a few times after initially getting our drinks and order. It would have been nice if she would have stopped by to reassure us that our order was on the way, and perhaps offer a comp for the extremely long delay. I'll definitely go back at some point to give it another try, simply because the food was so good. I don't want to negate giving it a second chance due to the possibility it was an off-night for the staff with service and timeliness.","Dined on March 2, 2022",4,5,3,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"We came for my daughter’s 17 birthday dinner which was a surprise to her. I chose the Pink Door because they have the aerial show on Tuesdays. When I made the reservation, I could only choose a table in the dining room which is not close to the performer. The lounge area is where the show is and it’s on a first-come, first-serve basis. I called to get an idea of how it all works and I was fine with a table in the dining room. But when we showed up, we were surprised with a table in the lounge! Not sure if they reserved it for us or if we just lucked out, but it made us feel special. My daughter LOVED the place, decor, ambiance and of course the show! Our server was very attentive and engaging. The food was good.

It has been six years since we last went for a date night at the Pink Door. We enjoyed sitting in the new addition in the back with the view of the water and pike place. The food was delicious as always and the atmosphere was wonderful. Just. Slight complaint. We felt our server was lacking in friendliness but they did answer our questions when we asked. The other thing is we had ordered the garlic bread and would have loved more and did not realized that we could have gotten free bread with olive oil dipping but was never offered this and witness all the tables around us get this. So I had no bread with my main entry.,"Dined on February 20, 2022",4,5,4,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Our all-time favorite is the crispy bread appetizer (perfectly crisped, perfectly dripping with delicious olive oil), although the mushroom-slathered bread tranches are also divine.  Hubby swears by the pappardelle al ragu bolognese.  Dad and I recently split the caesar salad and the rigatoni with mama's meatballs; both were perfection, avoiding the pitfalls of gloppy sauce, overdone (soft) pasta, and ordinary-flavored meatballs.  I always wish there were more vegetable sides, as straight pasta is, well, straight pasta.  A gracious three carrot slices, or two sprigs of perfect broccolini would take these plates to perfection, not to mention nutritive sanity.  

While the food is excellent, we always regret the cafeteria feel of the dining room: hard, noise-bouncing surfaces, detached wait staff (competent but not warm or relaxed), and a service style oriented more to moving tourists rather than developing long-term loyalty and relationships.   For example, once our waitress delivered the bottle of wine to the table and poured the initial glass, she never again poured or checked wine status.  It's a touch of graciousness entirely missing.","Dined on February 19, 2022",4,5,3,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

We ordered the clams and mussels for appetizer and had the salmon special and Caesar salad with Dungeness crab. The clams were really small and I’m guessing it’s out of season. But the wine sauce was really tasty. The salmon was a bit over cooked. The waiter did not ask how we wanted the salmon cooked. The Dungeness crab was a bit disappointing. The meat was too shredded and not whole crab meat. Other than that the meal was good and price is right.,"Dined on February 9, 2022",5,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"I have had some truly wonderful meals at The Pink Door; always with a dining companion. (Thus the 3 star review) This time around I was dining solo before the ballet and I can only assume, because it was just moi,  I got the reject table. You know the one, it’s right next to the bar with the rambunctious drunk guys and so close to the front door that you have a steady stream of people walking past you hitting you with their coats and bags as if you’re invisible.  Solo diners deserve some ambiance too. This afterthought of a table really dampened the experience. The soggy mushroom bruschetta didn’t exactly help either. I’ll be back with friends, but I won’t dine solo here again.","Dined on February 6, 2022",3,3,5,1,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Awesome food. Nice ambiance. We were lucky to have the view of the sunset and that made up for the early reservation we had. We have been trying to get a reservation at The Pink Door for a while and eventually decided to go one a weekday as that's what was available. The fish (market order) was very well cooked and they were happy to accommodate a slight modification to the order without hesitation. We could only try one dessert.

"Very cool spot. Located close to the water, I could see a patio that is probably open during the summer. Vintage building but   dressed up nice on the inside. Clean dining areas, back bar, clean restrooms. Service was great - waiters & waitresses were dressed up nice, the trapeze performances were awesome. We dined for 3 hrs and & saw one performance per hour. Since we attended on NYE there was a pre-fixe menu and it was very good. Fresh oysters, fennel salad, squid ink pasta w/ crab, short rib & pasta. They offered wine pairing but we declined and ordered a bottle of champagne. The dessert course was some of the best we have ever had. Chocolate coffee cheesecake & ricotta donut holes. Topped the night off with cocktails - Oh my word, a bourbon based cocktail with amaro & green chartreuse. And a twist on the Negroni cocktail with an egg white shake. 5 stars, would recommend, and we plan on returning.","Dined on January 1, 2022",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

A truly great restaurant to visit if you're in the area as the decor, service, and food were welcoming and provided a relaxing atmosphere to enjoy our lunch experience. The gnocchi with Gorgonzola, walnut, and pomegranate seeds was delicious and did not need the accompaniment of a protein as the components were flavorful and the gnocchi was very well made. The bread with truffle crema and mushrooms was a great start to the meal and our cocktails were just the right amount of sweetness.","Dined on January 1, 2022",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Another great meal at Pink Door! I had a 1/2 order of the antipasto della casa, and even that was enough for a full meal (loved the beans, salami, prosciutto, sautéed bell peppers, zucchini, etc.). Then the pappardelle Bolognese, which is as good as I've had in multiple trips to Bologna. Ending with a pear poached in red wine--a satisfying ending without being loaded with sugar--you could even say ""healthy"" :-). Finally topped off with an espresso that's for real (most restaurant espresso is bad stuff, here it's very good).

I opted for wines by the glass, starting with their Franicacorta (a sparkling wine from just east of Milan--better than most Prosecco's) and moving on to an Etna Rosso for the meal. Both were quite nice.

This is one of the best Italian restaurants in Seattle. Highly recommended. Just be sure to get a reservation!","Dined on December 31, 2021",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Wow, we really enjoyed our dining experience here! There's a lot of hype around The Pink Door, and reservation availability is scarce, and for good reason. Here are a few:

The food: We asked our server about her favorite dishes, and everything hit the spot. We *cleaned our plates* (sauce and all!) of the arancini, garlic bread, parpadelle, and lasagna dishes. We indulged and got two desserts, the bourbon boudin (a sort of pudding) and ricotta doughnuts -- my favorite! 

The entertainment & ambiance: We were originally sat in the back of the restaurant with a view of the Ferris wheel, it was lovely but we wanted a livelier vibe. We're grateful that the hostess was so accommodating of our request to sit in the main room. Luckily there was a table for 2 right in front of the live jazz band. We caught the last hour of their 3-hour set, and they were amazing. There's really nothing better than eating delicious food while listening to live music.

We came back within a week for the rive eye that’s perfectly delicious and better than anywhere I’ve had before. It’s 16 oz and big enough to share or take half home . I loved their Caesar salad as well as gnocchi and the lemon merengue pie was recommended as the top dessert choice so I enjoyed that as well as a hot cider whisky drink called caldo-caldo. We remembered our server from last week in a different section even though we weren’t seated to see the sunset over the bay this time we wanted to hear the band in the back lounge and we got great seats again! Thank you so much for getting us in with our ferry boat schedule challenges on a busy thanksgiving weekend!,"Dined on November 27, 2021",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Went with my boyfriend for lunch. Neither of us were especially into Italian food. I think we just never specifically sought out good Italian food before. Every item was delicious. We were very pleasantly surprised. There's a reason why this is a Seattle classic. If you're looking for fanciness this might not be the best choice. It's not the high-class feeling place like Canlis, but the restaurant is nicely decorated. We got the waterfront view and looked directly at people bustling about at Pike Place. For me, food is more important than fanciness, so this place is now one of my favourites.","Dined on November 27, 2021",5,5,4,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

We shared the arancini to start. They pack a spicy punch! The rigatoni and lasagna are al dente perfection with bright acid red sauces.

"Consider yourself lucky if you get to eat here. I only knew if this place from a rec from a friend and I had no expectations. From the minute we opened the door, I was so entranced by the ambience and old World feel of the place. We ordered the salumi appetizer and the goat cheese/tomato spread was so delicious. We ordered the lasagna from the waiter’s recommendation and went with the whole fish (Brandini). The fish was beautifully presented but the pasta was so delicious that if we had to do it again, we would have ordered 2 other pasta dishes instead of the fish. 

We had a window table, by luck, and it was neat to hear other languages at adjacent tables such as Korean and Russian and Hindi. It made the experience seem even more special. Such a treasure. Waiter was also attentive in refilling the bread bowl for my eight year old and accommodating a side of salami for her picky palate. Loved the whole experience. Best part of our quick Seattle weekend getaway.","Dined on November 15, 2021",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Our friends that were visiting wanted to try this restaurant because I always raved about it. They weren’t able to go to dinner anytime before 8pm so I checked for reservations and the only one was for 10pm. That is pretty late for dinner, but in my opinion would’ve been worth it because it was the Pink Door after all. 

My friends arrived a few minutes before the reservation and my boyfriend and I arrived at 1002pm (we were driving in from 30 miles North). When we saw our friends at the table the first thing they said “our waitress is rude she told us last call for food is 10pm and was asking how late you were going to be”… hearing this I was a bit confused as to why they would allow a 10pm reservation and close the kitchen at 10pm. 

Either way my boyfriend and I knew what we were going to order within the first couple of minutes after being seated. We kept seeing our waitress stop by every single table around us but never came to ask us what we wanted to order. She didn’t take our food order until about 10 minutes after we sat, no urgency on her part after her remarks to our friends. 

When she would come to our table there was an air around her (very negative). When she grabbed a plate off our table she just pushed her way between myself and the window without even saying “Excuse Me” or anything (I didn’t even know she was there). I wanted more iced tea for my refill and she said “I don’t think we have anymore, I have to check”.. I understand it was the ending of the night but if I knew there was going to be a shortage I would’ve gladly ordered something else. 

I thought that was the rudest service I’ve ever had at Pink Door. I don’t live close to there and try celebrate many special occasions with my friends there. I probably will not be back. I was very disappointed and embarrassed that I recommended a place with such rude, lacking service.","Dined on November 14, 2021",2,4,1,1,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"El servicio fue genial, algo que no me gusto es que hay algunos platillos principales las porciones son muy pequeñas, me quede con hambre pero el sabor es muy rico. Nos ofrecieron pan (como el que nos dieron al llegar) para acompañar nuestro risotto pensamos que era parte del servicio pero no, nos lo cobraron en 8 dólares. Disfrute mucho el ambiente es muy romántico. En general estuvo bien. 

The service was great, something I didn’t like is that there are some main dishes the portions are very small, I was hungry after 2 dishes but the flavor is very good.  They offered us bread (like the one they gave us when we arrived) to accompany our risotto, we thought it was part of the service but no, they charged us at 8 dollars.  Enjoy a lot the atmosphere is very romantic.  Overall it was okay.","Dined on October 21, 2021",4,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Visiting from Hawaii and wanted to finally have some good Italian Cuisine. I came alone, sat at the bar, and absolutely loved everything I ordered. The bar tender who took care of me was lovely and knowledgeable.
Highlight of the meal was the Arancini, Linguine, and Grilled Bread. Caesar salad was another hit and if I had a bigger stomach or others to share my meal with, I would’ve definitely ordered more.
Arancini was the best I’ve ever had, super crispy and the sauce was perfect amount of heat to compliment the lush tomatoe. Linguine was like 80% clams 20% noodles which isn’t a bad thing AT ALL. I was so excited because I was already getting full by the time it came out.
Another unique/cute highlight was the wine bucket that my bottle of Verdicchio came in. 
I would definitely come back but with some friends to share with.","Dined on October 15, 2021",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Our server was pleasant and attentive, though she needs to learn proper wine service. Our Barolo was done a bit of a disservice by her unfortunately. I'd recommend getting the sommelier or general manager to do wine service for you. 

Overall, a wonderful dining experience! I will definitely be back again and again.","Dined on October 8, 2021",5,5,3,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"FABULOUS EXPERIENCE! Went with five girlfriends for a birthday luncheon and the food was absolutely fantastic. Our table wasn't ready when we arrived but we were welcomed into the lovely bar seating where we had some wine while we waited for our table to be ready. We ordered Bruchetta to start that was amazing...the most perfectly grilled bread topped with the sweetest, freshest tomato slice, and topped with basil, salt pepper...subtle and not overdone. Between us we had the chicken caesar, the steamed mussels/clams, cioppino, and pasta, and each dish was so delicious. Our server was a bit disinterested or perhaps just having a bad day but he was practically humorless and lacked warmth. But in today's climate, we have to give everyone grace, we don't know what might be going on in their personal lives behind the scenes. Service was good, don't get me wrong, just wished for more engaging server.","Dined on September 23, 2021",5,5,3,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"This old Seattle favorite in the Pike Place Market expanded it's size 4+ years ago and this was my first visit since that time. The new space is elegantly done and continues the Pink Doors quirky, artsy, comfortable take on Italian style. A wall of windows along the far end gives views out across the market to nearby Puget Sound. Try the Squid Ink pasta, so well done.","Dined on September 11, 2021",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

But our anniversary day showed 5:30 pm available but only outside Seay. We found there were plenty of seats inside and outside. We chose inside seating. The food was okay…. Garlic lams as appetizer, mine was Ciopinni, anothe main dish was Pappadelle Al rago Bolognese. No unique taste on either one.

"It was ok dining there.  It was my daughter’s birthday so I wanted to make it special for her.

Seating:
I requested not near the bar/entrance area but by the window.  We were seated exactly I wanted but the problem was that the window was very dirty.  There were some large seagulls’s droppings on our window and not pleasant to look at when dining. Then, my side of the table cloth/paper and my napkin had fresh spaghetti stains on it thinking they did not fully cleaned/replaced my side of the table. I did not want to make a fuss so I just fold the stained area and did not say anything.

Service: Our server did not check in with us like she did with other table.  We would have ordered more drinks if she did.  Also, she did not bring new sets of silverware even foods came in. So, we had to wait for her to come around but never did so we had to ask the server who is assigned to the next table. I felt bad but what can we do, wait until the foods get cold?Also, we were not served the bread with entrees so I had to ask for that. She probably thought we do not need it because we ordered garlic bread but that is not right.  The appetizer dishes were still in the table until we finished our entree. I can praise the person who refilled water quite often.

Food: Lasagna is good as always.  The clam and mussels were overly cooked with butter and did not taste clams/mussels
Garlic bread was half burned and not even taste garlic. Could not have chance to ask for new one cause the server doesn’t come around. Squid ink spaghetti was already cold and the shrimp were tasteless. Only ate few bites and was expecting the server to question me but she failed.  Other dish like fries, egg plants, spaghetti were mediocre.
I was kind of expecting some special desert for my daughter but none of the came. I was surprised the server asked if we want to see desert menus. She probably forgot it was the special dinner, oh well. We did not order any desert so cannot rate.","Dined on August 22, 2021",3,3,2,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Overall: Food is mediocre. View is pretty, but plenty of other restaurants have a similar view and better food/service. 

Customer service was pretty bad. The waitress wasn’t that helpful with menu suggestions or checking in on us. Bus person weirdly wouldn’t fill out water glasses all the way up, so he had to keep coming back every 8-10 minutes. 

The music that was supposed to start at 7 didn’t start until 8, so it was just a noisy restaurant for the duration of our meal. 

Sunset over the water is nice but multiple tables had to ask the staff to lower the blinds because they were being blinded by the sun. Sunset happens every day - there should be a process where someone comes and pulls down the blinds so patrons don’t have to squint or literally wear sunglasses at their indoor tables. Disappointed that this is a date-night/special occasion place but dress code is very casual (workout shorts and flip flops) for many patrons. 

The clam linguine was bland and uninspired but the seafood was fresh. The rigatoni and meatballs were good, but nothing out of this world. The amaretto semifreddo was the best part of the meal. 

The building is cute and tucked away down a quaint alley. They require (on Aug 18th 2021) proof of vaccination but allow people to congregate at the front door with no social distancing. One of the elderly musicians was coming and going through the crowd at the door, bringing in his instrument and equipment and wasn’t wearing a mask at any time that I saw, inside or out.","Dined on August 19, 2021",3,3,2,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"While we shared when making our reservation that we were celebrating our anniversary, it seemed a bit disappointing that we did not get seated inside the restaurant where all the activities were going on. The service was amazing, and the lasagna is the best dish on the menu.
Dessert was ok, we we’re surprised that given the menu is Italian , we were surprised there was not a tiramisu or coffee based dessert on the menu.

We are on the fence to possibly return. The hype that others shared about having gone here was disappointing in the end for us.","Dined on August 16, 2021",4,4,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Really loved the booking experience on opentable. The ambience and staff was perfect! Its the most lovely place for a date night - both the seating and setting inside and outdoors.
Enjoyed most of the items we were recommended- the Pinot Noir went perfectly with the Lasagna Pink Door. Unfortunately the garlic bread was not the freshest and was chewier than we like it. The infused oils in it were nice though! From alot of reviews and recommendations which said it was not too sweet, we ordered the basil cake for dessert but it was extremely sweet for our taste even without the butter cream frosting. And i dont think my palate enjoyed the basil flavoured cake. All in all it was a 4/5 night.","Dined on August 15, 2021",5,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"I have eaten here before, and rated it much higher, so to be fair - they were just coming back from a COVID scare and a bunch of rearranging reservations as well as staffing shifts.
Food was excellent, and our server was a very nice young man.  The lower rating was given due to the fact that there was a table of 6 people in the center of the room, and one of the women was yelling loudly - to the point that my daughter and I thought that there was going to be a fight breaking out - turns out she was ""just conversing"" with her friends at her table.  I got the sense that everyone around them was very uncomfortable.  Once that party left, the atmosphere changed and people just seemed a lot more relaxed.  Too bad a manager didn't talk take her aside and let her know how loud she was being.  
The other thing that contributed to a lower rating this time - I asked for non-alcoholic beverage - perhaps a mocktail, and the waiter didn't have any suggestions, so I ordered a ginger ale.  I received what seemed tobe a club soda with some kind of gingery syrup that tasted like it had aspartame in it (yes - I can tell!).  I couldn't drink it, and never got the opportunity to tell the extremely busy waitstaff why - and nobody asked.
I would definitely go back, but not until things are a little more ""normal"" - this place is too expensive to waste on anything but excellence.","Dined on August 13, 2021",4,5,4,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Pink Door required a vaccination card to be seated and I loved it!  I haven't felt as comfortable outside my home since before the pandemic.  The food and service were AMAZING.  Best french fries in town.  The Cioppino was SO fresh and delicious.  They have a knowledgeable staff- (I've forgotten our server's name-oops).

I got sat in a corner with no light. I had to use my phone and the candle they had at the table to see the menu. They had one page for a food menu. The water they served was room temperature. The girl refused to accommodate my drink order. The lasagna I ordered came on a small plate (with nothing else). I had to practically force the staff to offer me the complimentary bread. The only good thing there was the guy who walked around and kept my water glass full (and eventually gave me ice),"Dined on August 6, 2021",1,2,2,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"Bravo to The Pink Door!  First for providing us a safe dining experience with your new “Proof of Vaccination” policy which immediately put us at ease and made us feel safe in your warm and inviting space.  Our server, and really our personal guide for the evening, Jessi, was the perfect compliment to the overall attention to detail and extraordinary service.  From the salad of simple greens and radishes, to the risotto which was cooked perfectly, to the lasagna my husband devoured.  The food was fresh, tasty and filling.  We ended the meal with the basil cake which was a great surprise of flavors! It was clear from the time we entered the restaurant, the entire Pink Door family really work together, love and respect their establishment and are clearly in the industry of service for ALL THE RIGHT REASONS!

We had planned on getting dessert, but we did not. We were too afraid that dessert would be as disappointing as the rest of the meal. 

The service was fine, nothing special. She was a little obtuse and didn’t ask whether we enjoyed the mains—she probably knew. Never going back, never recommending.

Rigatoni pasta arrived with marinara sauce meatballs and cooked perfectly al-dente. Pappardelle Bolognese prepared with fresh pasta in slow-simmered meat sauce..excellent, hearty and rich. Pasta dishes were their strong forte. Risotto with several vegetables was very good..flavorful, creamy and cheesy. Our choice of side dishes includes: Broccolini was excellent, charred grilled with raisins and pine nuts. Tuscan Fries was crispy and tasty..served with fried herb rosemary and the house aioli, a must to have. Entrees: Skirt steak came with salad and mashed potatoes was well-seasoned and full of flavor. Northwest fish of the day was the Wild King Salmon topped with white creme sauce. It was disappointing..overcooked and extremely dried. Wait staff was efficient and attentive. Service was exceptional. Will be back!","Dined on July 29, 2021",4,4,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"Perhaps it’s the pandemic, we did not have the usual great experience during a recent visit. Our reservation was made well ahead of time for a special occasion and I had requested an outside table. The four of us were shown a tiny outside table by the patio door close to the kitchen bussing area. Our finely-dressed guest sat on a huge puddle of water which was on her chair. We only had one menu to share for the table. Thankfully we were reseated without any issue when we requested  a larger table.  The small table could not possibly have accommodated all our food. We also got a menu each. The antipasti we ordered to start took a very long time as was the ice we requested for  our water. We never got one side dish we ordered. Great service was always one of the highlights of the Pink Door.

"It was our anniversary and we were seated next to a table of large people. We are not on the small size either but did not fit comfortably next to them. When asked to move we were given the equivalent of being to demanding. We weren’t, we politely asked but they made us feel like we were putting them out when there was plenty of space to move. Won’t be back due to lack of consideration. Food was okay but was not worth sitting in a cramped area.","Dined on July 23, 2021",3,3,3,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Great to be back. We'd done takeout during our last visit and made a lunch reservation two weeks in advance for this one. Pink Door is hard to beat in the summer: sitting outside, looking at Elliott Bay, and enjoying great food and drink. We went in different directions on the menu: one of us had an Insalata Misticanza and the ""Three Sisters"" summer risotto, the other went with small plates: Arancini, Ahi Crudo, and three Mama's Meatballs: did I mention that it's hard to beat? No problem finding veggie and gluten-free offerings, service is always outstanding, and it's just a fun place. Can't wait for heirloom tomatoes to arrive, because the heirloom Insalata Caprese is a must-order.","Dined on July 21, 2021",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The food was mediocre at best. We had rigatoni with meatballs (nothing special) and squid ink spaghetti (too salty, too oily, and 4 shrimps for $ 24 is a bit much). The salad that I had as a side was just insulting: three lettuce leaves and some radish for $ 11 is beyond my comprehension. The service was bordering on being rood. The place is incredibly overpriced. I have no idea where all these 5-star reviews come from. Worth neither the calories nor the money.","Dined on July 11, 2021",3,3,3,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"First timers at The Pink Door and it did not disappoint. All parts of the experience were exceptional. We were able to get reservations for lunch and sat outside on a patio that was made to enjoy your dining experience.

Our cocktails were perfect, mine was refreshing and light and my husbands was smooth. 

For appetizers we chose the Tuna and it was very yummy.

Mains, my husband had the seafood special of the day which was Salmon and I had the vegetarian risotto which was filled with flavor. 

We tried to order pastas to go as we thought that would be great for dinner and they denied us saying that unless we eat it right away it will not be ideal. Truly respected that and we are already looking for reservations to go back in the evening however that is a challenge. Fingers crossed we get a Friday or Saturday night dinner sometime soon.

Oh and our server Aaron was spectacular, very observant and attentive of our table and we in fact watched him monitor his entire section every time he was outside. He is definitely an added Gem to our experience.

Thank you Pink Door.","Dined on July 11, 2021",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

As usual the food was great; one of us had Pappardelle al Ragù Bolognese and the other had Risotto “The Three Sisters” with sweet corn, green beans, summer squash & their blossoms, parmigiano, basil. Both dishes were very well made with fresh ingredients and were delicious.

Pink Door has a decent wine list (if you like wines from the Piemonte region of Italy, I'd recommend the Travaglini Gattinara as one at a good price point that opens quickly with air and is a nice example of Nebbiolo).","Dined on July 8, 2021",5,5,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Most of all, thank you for reserving a table on the deck!!!

"Food was good but nothing very special or particularly imaginative. Pretty much what you would expect from an established Italian restaurant. Our waiter was nice and gave good suggestions for wine and our meal. There was something odd about the atmosphere, like the restaurant couldn’t decide if it was casual and funky or sophisticated. 

One thing that affected our experience was the presentation of the staff. A majority of the wait staff (our waitress being the exception) were all completely inappropriately attired and unprofessional. Think bra straps exposed beneath a faded racer back tank tops, commando boots and I in brushed hair in a shower bun. I realize that Seattle is world grunge capital but this took it too far. It was off-putting. If I am paying $200 for a meal I expect the staff to dress more professionally.","Dined on June 20, 2021",3,3,3,2,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

That's being said I have noticed the last  three times I have eaten there the wait staff and hostess have been rude and unpleasant. The first time I noticed this I didnt give it a second thought, but now I can honestly say it's not my imgaination.

I hope the Pink Door reads this and makes an effort to correct some of their staff.","Dined on June 4, 2021",4,4,1,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

AMAZING! I ordered the linguine and my boyfriend ordered the rigatoni with meatballs. The linguine came with so much clams! Loved it! The pasta sauce seemed simple but was delicious! Doesn’t seem like there were too many ingredients. I think a lot of the flavor came from the clams. My boyfriend loved their rigatoni with meatballs. I got a taste of it and the tomato sauce tasted fresh and was very flavorful. You can really taste the tomatoes but it wasn’t too sour or sweet. Just right. We would definitely come back when I’m back in the area. I want to try all their dishes! We had a reservation and were sat down immediately. Service was nice and fast and the food came out quick. We were l there for less than an hour and a half. Perfect weather and we had a view of the water. Such a great experience!,"Dined on May 31, 2021",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

The tuna crudo is without equal in Seattle, oyesters on the half shell were perfectly shucked and expertly served (brine was intact).  Frozen mignonette a fun and tasty take.

Vegetarian options are inventive, interesting and, like all the first and second courses, very well balanced.

"We have always loved the Pink Door and it will remain a favorite. On this trip, during Covid, we were seated on what is typically a beautiful patio. Strangely, there was a noticeable lack of effort put into sprucing the only seating they have up. There were no lovely flowers on tables, or touches to create the ambiance especially needed at this time of year if your only choice is al’fresco. We were there for a 3:30 late lunch early dinner, glass of wine on the sunny patio. 2 great 2 tops were wide open, with intimate surrounding and next to edge with “the view”. We were seated near the entry to the patio at a 4 top up against the wall. This is to keep waitstaff sections even but not always a great deal for customers. The food was good, not great. I’d give it a solid B grade.  They have been better in the past. Our waiter was great. Just right. Will I go back? For sure. I live here so it will be awhile. Do I hope they up the food game and ambiance they are known for? I do.","Dined on May 6, 2021",4,3,4,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Location:
Difficult to find because there was no sign anywhere on the building. The only indication is by the color of the door. Seating by the window offers fantastic view of the Pike Market. 

Food:
Excellent! Meatball was not salty at all, and the pasta was not greasy nor too light. Linguine had lots of clams! 

Service:
Tanya was very helpful and served us in a prompt manner.","Dined on April 25, 2021",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Husband and I went for our one year anniversary visiting from CO! The food was absolutely delicious. We ordered the grilled garlic bread to start and for our meal the lasagna and bolognese.

"👆 Yes I do need help. I visited your establishment on 4/24 at 1:30pm at which a friend and I were promptly greeted by the host staff. They were friendly, accommodating and efficient. We were soon sat a table that unfortunately was located in the center of the restaurant...and on the onset this was wonderful as we took in the magnificent views! Our waitress was also very friendly, knowledgeable, and has the patience of a Saint. Menus were promptly downloaded and a set of drinks were ordered with a appetizer to share. Now granted my friend and I are visiting Seattle for the first time and ecstatic at the new surroundings as some travelers will do, is enjoy an adult beverage. Well the bloody orange cocktail in its relatively tall glass was spilled and the glass broken. One would think... ""a simple mistake"", right? Well no sooner had the mess been cleaned up and the drink replaced... IT HAPPENS AGAIN! I shrunk in my seat, knowing I was fully to blame and apparently can't hold my liquor. I asked the waitress to bag our food as I needed to save face and get out of there as quickly as possible. She insisted we stay, the manager politely inquires if I was okay and even though I wasn't, I told him I was. Moral of this story... The Pink Door has amazing staff and delightful food, I on the other hand need a 12 step program.","Dined on April 25, 2021",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The Pink Door is highly overrated. The view is pretty good but the staff is rude and very slow. The way they are handling the covid-19 restrictions makes your visit uncomfortable. The food was terrible, especially for the price.

The servers are comfortably gracious and  attentive without being fussy; the fresh take on Italian fare takes full advantage of the PNW’s bounty, and the preparation and presentation of each dish delivers mouthwatering satisfaction. We’ve been dining here quarterly for 18 years and have tried everything on the menu- I honestly can’t pick a single favorite because it’s all incredible and never a disappointment. Maybe it’s how the light illuminates the environment and makes you glow. Everyone at the table can’t help but smile. A calm joy settles in around you. Your favorite people surround you and you are sooooo well fed. That’s pretty perfect.","Dined on April 17, 2021",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

I hate to review this place because then I’ll have more competition for a seat!  Doing a great job as usual.  Wish they’d open the patio up more often (it was upper 60’s this week and they said it was “too chilly” for patio dining).  My death row appetizer would be their antipasti.  I’ve been ruined - no other restaurant in the state has antipasti as good as the Pink Door.,"Dined on April 15, 2021",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

We watched him serve 3 other tables drinks,food and chatted. Never made eye contact with us even after nicely trying to get his attention.

The dining room is beautiful and the location can't be beat, and our server was incandescent ... but I think my expectations were a little overblown.  The real star here is the setting rather than the food, I think.","Dined on March 28, 2021",4,3,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

The Pink Door is always amazing.  I have certain food allergies that are a pain at other restaurants and The Pink Door always comes through with something inventive to accommodate them.

"Visiting from out of town and found this place within walking distance from my hotel.  Hard to find the door to enter but is a beautiful and welcoming space inside.  The waiter was the bartender and was very helpful during my dining.  I'm from ""bourbon country"" so when I ordered a bourbon drink called a ""Tom Waites"" I'm skeptical being in Seattle.  Wasn't sure it was good so I had to order another one.  Actually was delicious! My meal was the Risotto with a mushroom sauce and was wonderful as well.  Well worth finding and enjoying the cuisine.","Dined on March 22, 2021",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"1st thought’s come to mine-quite underwhelmed!  It was heartening to have waited and made reservations on our last evening in Seattle-to wait for
1.  The bread served pre-meal  was cold, hard and crusty(not in a good way); 
2. Though the service was good and the server was more than adequate-the suggestion of the drink was uninspiring and sure she said it had a flowery taste-but in this case that taste     was too flowery. 
3. When the main courses arrive well-
a . Tortellini was dough balls in soup-what they termed a broth-but it arrived (all 7 little pieces)-disappointed and disheartening-pasta tasted uncooked and cold-no offer of cheese(or packets, in a COVID world);

b. Rigatoni with meatballs was at best-uninspired!  The pasta again  bordered on being cold-almost lifeless.  I was looking forward to a decent marinara sauce and it best feature was that it looked good-but that was it.  Honestly the sauce I get out of a Hunt’s can tasted better.  Oh and then the meatballs -insipid-I expected flavor and to be brought to the old country-but no luck. 

All in all a disappointing outing that was cannot be reclaimed!","Dined on March 20, 2021",2,1,4,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
The pink door was not what we remember it to be. I think there is a new chief because the food was not up to standard. All of our plates came out luke warm. The food itself was incredibly average to below average. The waiter was awkward and super pushy about us ordering dessert. We will not be coming back to this restaurant. 120 dollar meal for a luke warm meal was not what we signed up for.,"Dined on March 20, 2021",1,1,2,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"First time back for indoor dining at Pink Door after COVID.  Everything was fabulous, as usual.  Excellent and attentive service, very nice table by the window.  Had the large antipasto plate which was loaded with traditional Italian treats like salami, prosciutto, veggies, mozzarella, etc.  A good size for us three.  Then had the Tortellini in Brodo, with the tortellini swimming in a an absolutely fabulous broth (3 days to make, they said). My wife had the lasagne and my son the linguine alla vongole.  Everyone was very pleased.  Dessert was the almond cake and the ""sex bomb"" (la bomba sessuale); both made in house and decadently tasty.

"My hubby and I visited Seattle on a short weekend trip and some friends recommended we visit the Pink Door. So glad we took their advise! We booked ahead and asked for a quiet romantic table (it was my bday weekend) and they did not disappoint. They sat us at a sweet little table overlooking the water- the view outside was gorgeous and inside the restaurant was warm and charming at the entrance  and filled with character. We passed a cool bar on the way to the other side of the restaurant that was bright and airy, equipped with a fantastic wall of windows along with some whimsical fresco type murals. Our server was lovely and recommended some real winners from the lunch menu, including the ahi tuna app which was tasty and the Pink Door Lasagna - which you must order if you like pesto, and my personal fav the Pappardelle Al Ragu Bolognese which melts in your mouth and is now probably my favorite pasta dish of all time (definitely my favorite Pappardelle ever) and I have been to and eaten in Italy several times. Overall a great experience- the only downside is that I am already craving that pasta and I live in Cali, so I guess we'll be booking another flight soon:)","Dined on March 7, 2021",5,5,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Both ate the Lasagna (on the menu for 39 years) and it was easily the best Lasagna dish I've ever had. We also had the brussel sprouts on the side and again, to die for. Really enjoyed our experience here, and we will make a point to come back on our next trip!","Dined on February 20, 2021",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

The servers were kind and gracious, outlining the covid precautions thoughtfully and explicitly. Food was delicious: I had the special (get it) and my husband had a delicious pasta (the one with guanciale). You MUST have budino for dessert! Nothing like it.

"The ambiance was very chic and the server was extremely attentive. I'm from Houston, and I'm used to bold and flavorful meals. I was hoping the pasta dish (clams with linguine)I ordered would have been bursting with flavor, but I was slightly let down. It lacked some seasoning,  but I was able to ask the server for lemon and that helped brighten the flavors up. All that said, the dining area was great and we had a wonderful view of Pike Place Market from our table.  A great experience for lunch at the market.","Dined on October 29, 2020",5,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Sunday brunch with friends.  No outside dining which caused some concern at first BUT after being showed our table, we felt very safe dining here. Large open room, tables well spaced apart, masks required when servers are nearby, QR scan menus, windows wide open, and just had some air purifier system put in.  They are taking the safety of their servers and patrons seriously, and we appreciate it!  Love the food, have always loved the food with ample portions.  Server was attentive without being bothersome.  Only complaint was the cocktails.  Didn't like my bloody mary --couldn't detail what was wrong, too much lemon? not enough spice? maybe just blah.  My friends moscow mule was too sweet for her taste.  But not worth complaining about and quickly moved on to a good bottle of wine.  Will continue to come back.","Dined on October 25, 2020",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Waitress was rude and made snarky comments when we asked if the kitchen had some sea salt or kosher salt. I understand and think it’s good for restaurants to not keep such things on the table but she was clearly put out with that request.  She made a comment again when we asked if we could get some fresh pepper for our salad.  On top of that the mussels were off.  Sometimes they can be hit or miss so I’m not slighting them for that.  The risotto is amazing.  Overall my previous experiences have been great. If this was my first experience I would not go back.  Risotto stood out but the service colored the experience unfortunately.,"Dined on October 24, 2020",2,4,1,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"You know you’re going to have a bad experience when you can’t even get greeted without approaching the hostess stand to initiate service. From the second we walked in we felt unwelcome, the service was absolutely horrid, from the bartender, to the hostess, to the server. The funny part about that type of arrogance is your food and beverages were terrible; If you were going to be snooty you should at least have the goods to back it up. Being from New York City I’m used to people being snooty, but again when the food and drinks are trash too, what’s the point in you all acting like you’re half worthy of your reputation? 5 people, over $500 and we all left very disappointed. 

It’s unfortunate that your location depicts your volume, Pikes Market is the only reason you’re special. My colleague tried to order a Cosmopolitan, and incase you didn’t know, they’re red. Hers came out yellow with pineapple. I would expect that to be pretty standard, but of course we had to explain ourselves to 5 different staff members to course correct. The attitude on these people was comical. In case you all didn’t know establishments are being forced to close due to Covid here in Seattle, therefore most restaurants staff are going above and beyond to make patrons feel welcome due to lack of business. I can say with 100% confidence your staff doesn’t deserve to have jobs, tips, or stability. I hope to hear you all close soon, cause there’s other places nearby that deserve your business as they focus on their customers. Shame on you.","Dined on October 16, 2020",1,1,1,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Excellent experience at the pink door. We split a bottle of Megan Anne Pinot Nior and went for some classic menu items, Pink Door Lasagna and Ragu Bolognese. Both food items were exceptional. The wine was some of the best I have ever had and didn't break the bank. Our server was polite and tentative. It's the perfect date spot. I can see why it has been around for 39 years.","Dined on October 5, 2020",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Table was booked for 7.30pm and arrived a few minutes early. Told our table wasn't ready and to wait outside on the alley. Thought 'fair enough' due to covid, however other guests appeared to be allowed to wait inside. Not sure why this distinction?? Waited outside to be called but no-one came for us so went back inside around 7.40pm and shown to a table that had been empty for a while. Service seemed slow as had to wait about 20 mins for our wine, though not sure what the pace is normally like as it was our first time at the restaurant. Waiter was helpful and courteous. Lasagne was very tasty but portion seemed small compared to other establishments. Overall, glad we tried it but won't be rushing back.","Dined on October 4, 2020",2,3,3,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

This is just a great restaurant. they require under covid that you have on your mask whenever your server is at your table so you are to flag them down when you need something which is ok by me.

"Pink Door was an amazing time! My boyfriend and I went for our anniversary and had the garlic bread, bucatini, lasagna, rosé and a cocktail. The garlic bread was so delicate and flaky and you could taste the high quality olive oil on it. The table focaccia was quite possibly the most delicious bread I have ever had. My boyfriend and I were in heaven. Of course the Lasagna was great, i see why it’s a favorite. Greta was our waitress and she was lovely, friendly and attentive.

We went to the Pink Door to celebrate our 20th anniversary. It was really nice out on the patio. The food was amazing. My husband had the grilled whole fish. I had crab risotto. We shared a green salad and tiramisu. It was all so fresh and perfectly seasoned so the flavors of the food came through. We really enjoyed our meal! Service was very good.

"During Covid-19, dining here was a treat, even if it isn't quite the same as the normal pink door experience. We were seated at a little table in the front corner past the covered patio area with an umbrella over us. It was good from the sense of social distancing since we were our own island, but it was a small spot so we found creative places to put our coats/purse. There also wasn't light above this table, but when asked we were provided several candles to help and it wasn't an issue. The food itself was mostly great. We started with the clams in herbed butter, then the little gem salad which had a delicious avocado dressing. We then shared the whole branzino fish, which was cooked just right though we weren't big fans of the accompanying beans and Verde sauce. We finished with their dense chocolate cake served cold (similar to an indulgent brownie), and we both agreed it would have been more enjoyable served warm, or a la mode. We did try items from their cocktail and wine menu which were good, but didn't have us commenting just how good like drinks we've had this week at other locations. Our waiter was polite, attentive, and helpful. I think that sitting in the corner table we had was an experience, but I might go for one with a little more room next time. I hope to be back again when things are more normal, and hopefully get that 5 star experience I know the Pink Door can provide.","Dined on August 10, 2020",4,4,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Where to begin?

The Pink Door is unparalleled under normal circumstances. Excellent food, friendly and overly-accommodating staff, and an amazing atmosphere.

In a COVID-19 world, the Pink Door has not only risen to the occasion, it has surpassed all expectations. When it comes to mandated health rules and restrictions, the Pink Door excels. For those of us who are not entirely comfortable with the government level of safety, the Pink Door goes above and beyond.

The host (whose mask was gorgeous) took great care to maintain 6 feet of distance at all times between customers, hosts, and other staff. Our server (Eiric) took the time to explain that, for everyone’s health and safety, customers should wear masks whenever the servers  approached the table. The servers and staff did an excellent job of not approaching without plenty of warning or waiting until signaled.  They provide an easy-to-use touchless pay option as the cherry on top.

If you haven’t already experienced the food, the Pink Door is easily one of the top restaurants in Seattle. COVID-19 has not diminished their excellence on any level.


If I could give more than 5 stars, I would.","Dined on July 27, 2020",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

I ended up with the Lasagna which was a uniquely delightful experience with the pesto sauce and spinich pasta.  I would definitely recommend that anyone in the area visits the Pink Door.

Only wish we could have stayed a little longer but by then the place was packed.  I would definitley recommend The Pink Door.,"Dined on March 6, 2020",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"There is a reason why the Pink Door has become a mainstay restaurant in Seattle. Since 1981 it has been serving delicious, fresh food in a space that is ambiance rich. It is so comfortable, almost like being in a good friend's home for a special dinner.  Eerick, our server was so professional in giving us outstanding service without being intrusive. You cannot go wrong with any menu choice. I had the Crab stuffed Petrale Sole with Lemon Piccata sauce, it was divine.","Dined on March 4, 2020",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"It was a nice experience and a good meal. The""pink door, "" was a little hard to find, because it's very discreet, and of the alley not the main road. The view was great. Our reservation was for 10:30pm, but I thought that I had made it for 5:30pm,so we milled around the alley for a while before dinner.  There were several nice little bars in there as well to pass the time . So it wasn't like we were just standing in an alley for 5 hours.  We also visited Kelles Irish Brewery and The Whiskey Bar while waiting.","Dined on March 1, 2020",4,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"We sat at the bar. The place itself is beautiful with nice, soft lighting, and the noise level was not too much, even with the band playing. The hostesses were OK. The bartender who was our server, not so great. She made minimal eye contact with us the whole time and gave a perfunctory smile when she handed us the bill. No, ""how's your food?"" ""how's your evening been?"" or anything.  Maybe she was just tired, but come on, when you're a bar tender in a sought-after place like this, you gotta just fake it (convincingly!) until your shift is over. That's your job. Paying that expensive bill after being snubbed was not a nice experience. I would try the place again because having a different server would have made a difference. If I were the owner of the restaurant and this bartender were my employee, I'd tell her to snap out of it, or else!","Dined on February 29, 2020",3,5,3,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Having friends in from Chicago, we booked the Pink Door for our good-bye and a birthday lunch. This is one of our go-to restaurants for visiting guests. It did not disappoint ! We ordered lots of appetizers: the special crab cake with tarragon sauce, rice balls, small antipasto and, of course, their grilled bread. So Good !!! Good portions too. My wife and I had the fish special, true cod wrapped in prosciutto ( what a combination ), our friends had the crabmeat salad and a huge meatball sandwich. No way that we could do dessert. Service, with Elise, was spot on. All in all a great success ! We will be going back. Soon !!!","Dined on February 26, 2020",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"Once we found the extremely nondescript entrance off of Post Alley, it was amazing from that point on.  The atmosphere is a funky, nostalgic, chic vibe.  Walking to the back of the restaurant it gets even better once you see the view of Puget Sound.  Our waiter was also wonderful, and even informed us of the next performance so that we could grab our drinks and go watch.  

Then there's the food.  Awesome.  If you want the best salad, split the Caesar Salad.  We had ours topped with crab meat (vs chicken or shrimp).  One of the best Caesar salads that I've ever had.  But it's not small, so either get it as an entree or split it with someone.  Also the lamb ossobuco was heavenly and the oxtail filled ravioli was superb.  Overall it was great and we will definitely be back to enjoy another great evening of delicious food, ambiance, and the view!","Dined on February 25, 2020",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"We had a great meal, a great evening, are looking forward to going back.
My only complaint is with mediocre service:
I was made to feel high maintenance for asking if I had to filet my own fish.  For these prices, someone should have offered.
Also our wine glasses were removed before our main course arrived, without a word, and without asking us if we wanted another glass.  That was particularly surprising.
The staff is all young, and may need a little more training.","Dined on February 20, 2020",5,5,3,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"5 stars for the food/service/ambiance. I've dined here on several occasions and every experience has been wonderful. My favorite dishes are the cioppino, lasagne, and chicken Marsala. The wine list as beautiful so many options and curated list of great wines abroad and locally. I brought in my own bottle of wine and our server welcomed it and decanted it. Then today, I dined here for lunch, my husband and I ordered a carafe of the house red and it was great too! Service is professional, attentive, and they take pride in their work and the food as if you were dining in their house...Great hospitality!! The restaurant is stunning and the views are amazing.

"However nice the ambiance is and the food is, our waitress, Lola, made our evening. She was magical, showing up whenever we needed her and somehow appearing time after time without any of the abruptness of most servers. I've never had a better server and I'm 65 years old. The food was good, but I wouldn't say spectacular. I had the Osso Buco with polenta. It was cooked nicely, but lacked any lamb flavor. The sauce had a sweetness to it, that was okay, I just don't prefer it that way. My son had an excellent spinach lasagna. My husband had the pasta with meatballs and sausage, again good, not great. We all shared the Charcuterie tray, good, but I thought the pate was lacking flavor. Can't beat the view and the service.","Dined on February 18, 2020",4,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The food was lackluster..  I had high expectations considering the amount of effort it takes to get a table here... sadly, it's the worst of the pricey italian restaurants Seattle has to offer. 

We tried their crispy duck leg, which was soggy. The flavor was nothing special. Not bland, but nothing great.. as we tried two other entries, the paparedelle,  and the lamb. The lamb was unseasoned, completely raw . We ordered it medium rare as per recommendation.  It was borderline inedible.  The pasta pappardelle,  was bland.
We also ordered some specialty fries , which sadly were the best item we tried.
The service was good, but painfully slow. We arrived at 7, seated around 7:05, yet didn't recieve any food til nearly 830..","Dined on February 16, 2020",2,2,5,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

The entrance is on street level but once you walk in, you go down a few steps to the main level of the restaurant. Great service and excellent food. We had the Salume/cheese board for starter. I had the squid ink pasta and my boyfriend went for the Linguine de Vongole. Both were very good.","Dined on February 16, 2020",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"I wanted to love this place, however, I walked away feeling very disappointed that I had been so passionate about visiting this restaurant while I was on vacation in Seattle. 

My partner and I went to eat here on Valentine’s Day. It was bustling and loud to the point of being unable to hear one another from across the table, which was expected, but we weren’t expecting to have such an awkward waitress and mediocre food for the price point. The speciality cocktails were also nothing to write home about either. I have very little positives to say about our visit other than the ambiance was as wonderful as I was hoping it would be and one of the hostesses was very pleasant as she checked us in. 

I doubt I’ll go out of my way to secure a reservation here again as it’s all hype with no follow through.","Dined on February 15, 2020",3,2,2,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

The bartenders were attentive and friendly. When we were escorted to our table, the hostess even carried our drinks on a tray and made sure the bar bill seamlessly transferred to our server, which was a nice touch. Our table was nice and the candles helped set the mood for the room. Our server was quite knowledgeable of the menu, and was patient with our questions, as well as our decision to eat at a bit more leisurely pace this evening. To top it off, he treated us to some Prosecco so we could toast the occasion. That was a lovely touch, too. Our food was good, but it was the service that made our anniversary dinner so enjoyable.

"The food and ambiance were fabulous! We had a couple of annoyances though that made for a less than enjoyable experience. The bottle of Prosecco we ordered had different prices on their food versus drink menu. The waiter apologized and said we’d have to pay the higher price and that the lower priced menu hadn’t been updated. Then, we ordered one of the specials, which was described as having 6 ounces of fish. The waiter let us know that they’d run out of the fish but could substitute scallops with the same sides for $4 more. We said okay and ordered it. Upon being served, we were disappointed that the meal only had 3 scallops! No where near the 6 ounces of the original fish offered. While I understand that fish varies by price, if the restaurant runs out and offers a substitute the substitute should be comparable in size and at the same price. That they raised the price and served less food left us with a negative attitude toward the restaurant and the way they handled it. Perhaps because both the beverage and food had issues, we were more affected. Not a great first time experience.","Dined on February 6, 2020",4,5,3,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Visited Seattle and went to The Pink Door for my birthday lunch. The food was excellent! The lasagna, their signature dish, was some of the best I’ve tasted - creamy ricotta cheese, thin spinach lasagna, and not heavy. The raw vegetables with olive oil and anchovy dipping sauce was delicious! And the risotto was tops too! Loved the decor and view. Sad we didn’t get to see the aerial performers, but the restaurant was the best one we went to on our trip!","Dined on February 2, 2020",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

We had a party of six and had a wonderful evening. We were seated right by the window in that large room overlooking the waterfront and our only criticism was that the sound level in that room from customers was high (and couldn’t be avoided). We didn’t need the additional sound of the singer from the bar area in addition; I would turn the speakers with his audio off.,"Dined on January 29, 2020",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

The Pink Door always pleases and is a great place to meet friends or have a cozy romantic dinner with your spouse.  This time I went for a lunch with the girls and selected something off the fresh sheet.  It was fantastic as always.  We shared a carafe of the house red wine and spent a couple of hours chatting away the afternoon.  I don't think you would be disappointed with any of the menu items but the restaurant is popular and can be a bit noisy when it fills up.  I would suggest making a reservation and shooting for an off time like 11:30am for lunch or a 6:30pm dinner.,"Dined on January 23, 2020",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

However, I did not realize that you have to book a table at the bar or lounge area to see the shows during dinner. If you are sitting in the dining room, you can leave your table and return after the show. The food and service were great as was the ambiance.

"My girlfriend and I had a great experience here. The entrance is unassuming, and could easily be missed, but is a namesake pink door. The interior ambiance was nice, although it did get quite loud during lunch. We got a table in a section which overlooks the bay, which was nice too. The food was very tasty (we got lasagna, a seafood stew, tiramisu, and prosecco wine) with big portions. Service was slightly hurried due to the busy lunch hour, but was still friendly. The restaurant also has trapeze and burlesque shows, but unfortunately none were scheduled at the time we were there. 

Highly recommend this restaurant when visiting Pike Place, but reservations are a must.","Dined on January 19, 2020",4,5,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

We started with the Caesar salad, with a dressing that clearly was authentically made, with just a bit of anchovy paste for saltiness.  We both had the flourless chocolate cake in port wine sauce for dessert - yumm!  The view of the Great Wheel and the market just topped off the ambiance of the room.

Afterwords, there were four of us, we discussed the price and have decided that it’s just way expensive to go out to dinner anymore. So will be staying home and making her own dinner parties much more frequently.  Pink Door has remained one of our favorite places over the years. We’ve probably been there more than any other restaurant in Seattle. Oh, and in addition we did get me a bottle of wine off your wine list. We usually bring some and buy some.","Dined on December 9, 2019",3,4,2,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Overall, the food at Pink Door is good. Yes, it's a little pricey and some of the portions are small. However, it's one of those spots you pay for the ambiance and experience. I was lucky to go on a Monday night which is the night they do the Aerial Acrobatic performance. (No pictures allowed!)  The service is good, the server kept coming back to check on my table to make sure our water was filled and that we enjoyed the food. Their specialty is the vegetarian lasagna which has spinach and pesto in it. It was good and creamy but felt like it didn't have enough sustenance to it. The Vongole pasta was good, again just your typical vongole linguine. Nothing special about it but I still enjoyed it. I also got a side of the meatballs since we felt like we needed some meat and those were decent as well. Not bad but nothing special. Lastly, also got a side of their Tuscan fries and the portion for this was huge! Super tasty as well! Loved the garlic and herbs and the fries were crispy. Definitely worth it to get the fries! 

In terms of drinks, I ordered a sophisticated lady and it was a nice cocktail. It was sweet and fruity but still had a good amount of liquor in it. 

The restaurant is very cute and intimate. A nice place for a date-night for sure. Or perhaps a small girl's night.","Dined on December 3, 2019",4,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"I've been to The Pink Door a handful of times, and each time I walk away thinking it's the only restaurant within Pike Place Market worth the fuss. The prices can be a bit on the fancy side, but for that you get consistently fantastic, filling meals. My only gripe is that service can be hit or miss. The staff is friendly and makes helpful recommendations, but is often forgetful about simple things like silverware and drink refills, to the point where I've felt forgotten if I'm with a party of several people. It's perfect, however, for a date. Make a reservation for dinner in the back room or sit at the bar for lunch, and enjoy a carafe of wine or their fantastic cocktails and it feels like you're the only two people in the world, in the best possible sense.","Dined on November 30, 2019",4,5,3,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

She was sleeping in her kennel the entire time and they placed us in a perfect spot (corner table) where we could sneak her under the table, out of sight. I know how making such concessions can result in eyerolls from other customers (we are not making this a habit, by any means), so I am really grateful for their flexibility.

"The four of us celebrate our multi decade friendship with a quarterly  lunch to honor the birthday of each friend. The Pink Door staff treat us with gracious professionalism and always a touch of delightful wit. The menu never ceases to be fresh and inspired, the Pink bubbles flow, the laughter ensues, and more memories are made. The Pink Door environment is a marvelous cross of Mediterranean elegance and French Bistro.  We always share multiple appetizers. We love the Antipasto platter, the beet salad, fresh oysters with pink peppercorns mignonette, roasted cauliflower, followed with the risotto of the season, their famous meatballs, and a choice of many delightful salads. Sometimes we share an entree - then finish with a perfect cappuccino and the Budino - the most heavenly butterscotch pudding topped with a shot of scotch. Oh yes please!  It’s truly a feast of the senses. The place is always packed, so reservations are a must. This is a truly well run establishment and we often see the manager make her rounds, greeting guests and taking care of every detail. She doesn’t miss a thing! We truly feel cared for and encouraged to relax and take our time.

"What a completely extraordinary restaurant! No sign out front. Just a pink door! Perhaps this would not be possible in an age before GPS!!!

The restaurant has high ceiling. The decor is semi garish but somehow comfortable. The ceilings are high enough to accommodate a couple of trapeze type devices: one a swing, and the other a ring. On 2 nights a week in the large bar area there are 2 brief aerial shows involving a woman dressed in costumes such as satin shorts with sequins. Music plays and there is a dance aerial show combination that is artful and athletic. Very unique!

But the star of the restaurant is, quite rightly, the food. The freshest ingredients. The most careful preparation. Simple and absolutely fresh oysters. The 3 meat ball offering makes a good appetizer. The lasagna is delicious. But the star of the stars is the marinara. The best I have ever eaten! Incredible!!!

And a great wine list.","Dined on November 12, 2019",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Had an incredible dinner at The Pink Door -- probably one of the best meals I've had in Seattle! 

My recs for an enjoyable night at The Pink Door:

-Cheese Board Deluxe. If you like cheese, get this board. It's amazing.

-Lasagna Pink Door. Our favorite dish of the night. I didn't think lasagna could taste so good. Pink Door has perfected marinara sauce. All other marinaras are going to pale in comparison to this sauce.

-Make a reservation. Don't expect to walk-in. Sometimes they have availability but when we left at 7PM on a Saturday, they had a sign on the door that said their walk-in list was full.

I'm already planning when we can go back. The Pink Door is my new go-to when we have visitors in town.","Dined on November 3, 2019",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"I have always loved the PD - summers on the deck and winters in the newer bright room over the market. It's a wonderful venue.  I am curious, however, why servers have gone to using pronouns such as we, us and our?  ""How are we doing today?"" ""What is our choice for lunch today?""  This makes me crazy and I find myself wanting to say, ""We have decided you will pay the bill.""  I suspect it is someone's training idea to bring the server into relationship with the diners but it feels contrived and insincere.

"Had a table with a view of the water and got to see the sunset.  I had the cioppino which was warm and delicious (and they customized it for because I can't some kinds of seafood). My husband had the lasagna which was, seriously, the best lasagna I've ever had!  When the trapeze artist was due to start her show, we were invited and encouraged to go and watch it.  Her performance was beautiful.","Dined on October 28, 2019",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"Overall a great experience.  Would have been a nice touch to offer a real wine glass with the house red carafe of wine,  instead of a regular drinking glass.

"The Pink Door is an eclectic, beautiful restaurant in the Pike Place neighborhood.  You must get a reservation weeks in advance, but it is worth it.  The service is good, but was a little slow at times.  The atmosphere is lively and fun.  But the food is amazing.  We had the cheese board, which had 4 amazing cheeses with outstanding compote sides.  My wife had the gnocchi with gluten free pasta and it was fantastic.  My son had the rigatoni with meatballs and loved it.  I had the bucatini and it was the best pasta meal I've had outside of Italy.  It was simply awesome.  They do have many gluten free options and are kid friendly.","Dined on October 27, 2019",5,5,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"This is an above-average Italian restaurant inside the Pike Place Market. As mentioned by a lot of patrons, the place is difficult to find without a sign. We walked past the restaurant a couple times and finally had to call for directions only to realize we were standing right outside. I am puzzled why they didn't just put up a sign when clearly we were not the first one to have the problem. And the restaurant is huge; so I can imagine the number of calls they have to field each day on that alone. To me, it comes across as uncaring, a bit egotistic and tone deaf. Coupled that with the expensive parking ($24), it is not a place I would return.","Dined on October 26, 2019",3,4,4,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Went there on a packed Tuesday evening with our son and daughter-in-law. First time, but we had luckily reserved our spot on Open Table. We each ordered a different entree and shared bites. Halibut, autumn risotto, pappardelle bolognese, lasagna. All four of us loved every bite we tasted of all four dishes! Even the house white wine, Pinot Grigio was good!

This restaurant is well worth it! The lasagna was to die for and I will for sure be dreaming of it. My husband I were visiting  Seattle and decided to grab a late Sunday night reservation at this restaurant. The original reservation was for 9:30 pm but we wrapped up our activities and were at the restaurant around 8:30 pm and were seated promptly. It has a very romantic and intimate vibe but still can be casual. People were both dressed up and also in casual attire. Any meal off their menu is delicious. We ended up doing the pumpkin cake for dessert and it was mouthwatering. I highly recommend this restaurant!!!!,"Dined on October 21, 2019",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Came here for dinner with hubby and our toddler--the food and trapeze entertainment was excellent! Highly recommend especially as a date spot, but the trapeze artist really did captivate my daughter's attention, allowing her dad and I to enjoy our meals. The ribeye steak had a smokey taste that was really good, it came with buttery mashed potatoes. I got spaghetti for my daughter which she loved, and I got the bolognese (also really good)! We shared a brownie dessert that was yummy too, but by far I must recommend our favorite thing that we ordered which was a bottle of the Cadence Cabernet-Franc wine. It was very good, paired well with both of our meals. Next time we visit Seattle we surely will be back!","Dined on October 15, 2019",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Review: For my first trip to Seattle with my special guy, I wanted to lunch somewhere that was totally “me” and this spot hit the nail on the head. Or should I say, fit the mold (there are gilded casts of cherubs, among other sweet things). Victorian meets postmodern beauty in this hidden pink place (He did the gps location as we walked, but I was the cool one telling him that the pink door meant the right spot). I would soon find out that the decor played second fiddle to the food, my lasagna was tangy and perfect.","Dined on October 13, 2019",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Claiming this happens all the time. Asked us to have a seat and see what they could do for us. Less than 10 minutes later we were escorted to our table as if they were expecting us all along.

Our server was LouLu, pretty sure I have her name wrong but will not forget the incredible service we received from her. She was fun! enganging! knowledgeable!  Pinot Grigio was deliciously chilled! Most of the food was outstanding - garlic was slightly overwhelming in the pasta.

We asked the server to decide between two entrees and she brought a half a order of each of the dishes to my husband because she loved them both.  This has never ever happened to us and we ask servers to do this alot.  Both dishes were excellent - he had the pasta with sausage and one with ragu.  I had the veggie lasagna which was delicious and rich.  It was an enjoyable dinner with entertainment in the lounge.

"This place is fantastic. Live entertainment and delicious food. I was on my own and easily got a seat at the bar. They do serve full menu at the bar. I had an antipasto platter with perfectly seasoned veggies, olive tamponade (done proper with anchovies), lima bean salad, fresh cut salami and prosciutto. My main was scallops in herb butter served over a green salad. These may be the best scallops I've ever eaten. I really was eyeing the steak but the bartender talked me into the scallops and and I'm glad she did! Had it all with a perfectly crafted dirty martini. I wish I could give this place 6 stars.

"A fairy book story night for us at The Pink Door, celebrating our 40th Wedding Anniversary. Staff had been tipped off so our most adorable server Andrew treated us like royalty. We began with Prosecco, then moved on to some excellent red wines by the glass. We each had a misticanza salad, lovely oil and balsamic vinegar pairing. One of us had the Cioppino, heavenly seafood in a perfectly spiced broth and one had the Fennel Encrusted Tuna, accompanied by a delightful mix of cucumber, fennel, celery tops. Delicious all around. The pace of the extravaganza was perfect and the ever attentive Andrew mentioned that the trapeze artist was about to perform so he held dessert. That performance was a real treat and amazing. Our dessert included 3 candles-one for the past, one for the present and one for the future-quite touching to us. Andrew finished our evening with an interesting Amaro liqueur. We cannot wait to return to Seattle to see Andrew and dine at The Pink Door.","Dined on September 17, 2019",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Would have been sufficient for lunch but we ordered more. The salmon cake turned out to be a salmon burger and was to die for... half fresh salmon and half smoked salmon.....this kitchen knows what it's doing!

"TERRIBLE. If I could give this place less than a star, I would. 
The only thing nice about our overly awful lunch would be the wonderful waitress - she was a delight to talk to and did genuinely want us to have a good time. 

But the food was AWFUL, I couldn’t even get the main course down my throat. The hostess was arrogant and said she wouldn’t hold our table 1 minute longer than expected. 

The decor - oh my god - the plastic covers were disgusting and the view was definitely not worth the bill. Cleanliness and service consideration level was also very low. 

While booking I was told if it’s a special occasion, which it was, they’d do a happy birthday writing if we ordered a dessert. We did order a dessert for my husband’s birthday and all we got a wax-dripping, oddly-placed candle. Disastrous start to birthday celebrations! 

Definitely not worth the hype and sooooo not worth their ridiculous prices.","Dined on August 31, 2019",1,1,2,1,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

We split a full fish and they didn’t even offer to debone it for us which is how those are typically served. All in all it’s a tourist trap.

"Because it is so hard to get a reservation online we had to go for a late lunch around 3:30. The only seating was outside. The view isn’t great from out there, the sun was shining directly in my face. There was no music playing or anything. I understand their hype is for dinner in the lounge but they could definitely do better for lunch. The food was pretty good but honestly overpriced for a lunch menu without a great ambiance.","Dined on August 20, 2019",3,3,4,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

It was a bit warm in the restaurant and we needed to request ice for our water to try to not sweat during the meal. I ordered the crab risotto and it was just okay. Dessert was blah along with the garlic breads We started with. The fried rice ball appetizer with fontina cheese was great! I usually go once a year to this place and order the lasagna, which is always pretty good, but I decided to switch it up. There are better fine dining places in the city, I think their reputation supersedes the actual food.

I can't really remember the name but it was something like that. Here's the thing...it had yellow charatreuse!, vodka, and lemon and it was my favorite drink ever.

Also the server had really great teeth. He gave us champagne because it was our anniversary. We sat at a window and stared at the market and the Sound. It was pretty awesome.

I ordered the crab risotto and there was an underwhelming amount of crab sprinkled on top. The crab is the only reason why I picked the dish in the first place. It wasn't anything to write home about. The garlic bread was to die for though. I would have been happy with just that as my meal.","Dined on August 4, 2019",4,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Absolute best restaurant in Seattle. Went for lunch the day we arrived in Seattle before our Alaska cruise and the day our cruise was over. We sat outside and it was so pretty and airy. The food was fabulous and my personal favorite was the tri-color tomato bruschetta. Tomatoes as fresh and ripe as you could hope for. The saffron arronchini was great as well. Meatballs, pasta dishes and a specialty pizza (prosciutto, burrata) were all amazing. They have specials everyday in addition to their regular choices. Also nice summer cocktails and even the house White was nice. But both times we had lunch, the staff could not have been more professional or personable. They were so attentive but we never felt rushed. They were stellar! All in all, a perfect experience and one I will be sharing with everyone I know traveling to Seattle!

"Reservation at 6:30 on a Sunday.  Popular, already crowded, need to book well in advance.  Window table with view of Public Market and harbor.
Mojito and martini to start, both were excellent.
Wife had the Misticanza salad with nice selection of greens; I had the Pink Door Caesar, no anchovies.
She had the risotto with crab meat and corn which was very nicely done.  I had the lamb porterhouse, a generous portion with beans and an artichoke flan-type side.
Three scoops of ice cream shared took care of the dessert side.
Mario B. was our server and took the time to ask the bartender and kitchen about questions we had regarding preservatives and allergies.","Dined on July 25, 2019",5,5,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Went with my mom for lunch during our road trip and that was a pleasant experience. Everything was well prepared. As for main dish we enjoyed white king salmon the most. It was tender and moist. The sauce was tangy and light along with combination of various local veggie. We had gelato and cheesecake for desert. We have had gelato all over Italy but this one is better. It was super silky and light. A perfect finish for the meal.  My mom said she would fly here just for gelato!,"Dined on July 23, 2019",4,5,4,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

It was recommended to us, so we went. We know Italian food well. This food was just ‘ok’. The meatballs were extremely dry. 
The hostess was a little on the unfriendly side. However, the drinks were good and the bruschetta was excellent! Our service was great once we were seated. 
The restaurant was beautiful. 
The main entrees need work. May not be worth it. 
I would say, go for drinks and appetizers and enjoy the ambiance.","Dined on July 23, 2019",3,3,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
Sat outside on the patio on a beautiful day. The crab Caesar was delicious. Service was attentive but not obtrusive.

It’s become  a tradition when my friend visits that I take a day off and we dine here with his mom. We have had the best meals and conversations here. Been lucky enough to get outdoor seating on the deck the past few summers. Food is always excellent and they’re always helpful in avoiding putting garlic in my friend’s mom’s dish when we ask.  She’s a colon cancer survivor and can’t handle digesting garlic. I failed to take photos of our food this time and am writing this review so late I can’t remember what we had.

"Good food and atmosphere but our service was horrible, made us not want to go back.  Server asked if we wanted an appetizer and we ordered one with him. When it had not showed up for 25 minutes and tables that sat down after us were getting their meals, we asked and he said he forgot. He never asked how we wanted the steak cooked. It showed up extremely rare and even after sending back it to make medium it was still on the rare side. He knew nothing about wine but at least he admitted that and brought out a tablet that gave a full description of each wine. At the end of dinner he put both the check and the then later the credit card receipt for signature in between my wife and my son's date when I was clearly the one paying.  When we booked the reso on open door, it asked if this was a special occasion and I checked it was a birthday.  My son's date also said something to the server when she stepped out for moment and nothing ever came of either request.  I finally asked him at the table and he said, ""We don't do that unless you want to buy one then I'll put a candle on it"".  Seriously, I drop nearly $200, get lousy service and then you can't pop for a scoop of ice cream or a cupcake?  Management - Please train your staff on your time not my nickel and deliver a little something extra, especially when you botch the entire night.  After we left, our conversation for 10 minutes was how the evening was a disaster from a service standpoint. Not the impression you want to give at Pink Door one would think.","Dined on July 13, 2019",3,4,1,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"Best thing about this place is the view on a good day from the outdoor seating area. They did not have enough staff and our waiter could not manage. We waited a long time to order, a very long time for our food and when it finally arrived it was cold and bland. We couldn’t flag anyone down to refill our drinks nor bring our check. I don’t recommend for a special occasion but would be Ok for a social gathering and drinks. It was also very loud and crowded.","Dined on July 13, 2019",3,3,2,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"I was a little disappointed.  After all the hype and recommendations for this restaurant I feel like I have had better food.  It was good, not great.  I had the lasagna, while I loved the pasta and the pesto I feel like it needed a little more seasoning.  Maybe just some salt, or a little garlic.  I made the reservation for 3 pm with an outside table requested.  I should have requested ""no sun""  we were sat in the sun and I have skin cancer so I cannot sit in the sun.  When I requested to move to another open table I saw we were denied.  We were moved to a very tiny out of the way table in the corner of the patio.  It felt like we were being punished for requesting to move.  So my suggestion is, dont make any particular request or you may be punished and sent to the corner.  The best thing about this restaurant was our server.  She was perfect in every way, such a gem!  I really wish I could remember her name, however we ate at SO many great restaurants and had good service everywhere in Seattle.","Dined on July 12, 2019",4,4,5,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

It came really al dente so I had to send it back, and although it came little more cooked it was still al dente. The worst part was the flavor. It tasted worse than the clam pasta I easily make at home.  Flavor was off!

However, she took the plate away & said a new one would be back shortly. Bottom line was, the new salad never showed up. The other 3 people had finished their meal and were ready to order dessert.

"There was nothing special about the Pink Door except the decor and ambiance. We did not attend one of the shows, just a late lunch. The pasta was good but not remarkable, the size was generous, but overall quite expensive (understandable given the location). Unless you're constrained to the area, I would recommend pasta elsewhere.","Dined on July 7, 2019",4,3,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"It is not often when a restaurant exceeds expectations, but this place did.  Hostess was lovely, welcoming, and quick to get us seated.  You guys ever meet that lovely young hostess at that awesome eatery.  She's hot, she knows it, and she treats most of us as if she is doing us a favor to even grace us with her time much less alone a table at her place of employment where she might be making $17 an hour.  I detest this hostess, occasionally it is a male but usually female.  Anyway I digress, this hostess was lovely and nice.  My only complaint was that i came in with a starbucks nitrobrew that was half finished.  The hostess told me i could not bring outside drinks s to the table.  I proceeded to inform her that most fine dining establishments allow outside drinks if they are transferred to another glass.  Anyway she consulted the manager  and voila my coffee was intact.  The waitress was a saucy little number who exuded confidence and charm.  All the food was perfect, from the bread with olive oil, to the caesar salad with crab, to the handmade lasagna.  We also had a pappardelle with bolognese, rigatoni with marinara sausage, and meatballs.  Then we had a berry shortcake!!  Everything was amazing!!","Dined on July 6, 2019",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"We ordered the cioppino as an app and rigatoni w/ meatballs and pappardelle for our entrees. The hype is real. The best pasta we have ever tasted. 

Be sure to book your reservation well in advance and try the watermelon margarita. Unfortunately, we were stuffed but if you have the opportunity order dessert, the lemon curd cheesecake to be exact!","Dined on July 5, 2019",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

After walking into an unmarked door, we walked into what felt like a dungeon with a strange smell. As we were seated, we noticed our utensils were dirty. Our waitress was not friendly and seemed to merely tolerate us. 

The menu was basic, the food was average and the pasta was very dry. The saving grace was the live music, which we enjoyed but the bread and oil was probably the best part of the meal. Never a good thing.

"I am so so happy I listened to other Yelpers and made this a ""must go"" on my trip to Seattle! We were only seeing the city for one day and with how in demand this place is, decided to go with a 3:00 pm early dinner reservation rather than wait for hours at peak time. It was perfect weather so  we dined on the patio and it was literal perfection. Started off with an amazing bubbly glass of prosecco, then had the rigatoni with meatballs. So fresh and delicious. BUT my biggest advice is to GET THE RICOTTA CHEESECAKE. We asked for a side of strawberries with it. But it was the best thing I have ever tasted in my life. Packed with so much flavor, my friend literally drooled when she took the first bite. Didn't want it to end. They also put a little candle on it for my birthday - loved the acknowledgement!

The performer was fantastic and very friendly. She came up and greeted us when she was finished with her performances. We started with oysters, then had the salmon (fish of the day), and finished with the chocolate mousse. Everything was delicious! We were so impressed with the service, food, and ambiance. We will definitely come here again!","Dined on June 11, 2019",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The food at The Pink Door is exquisite -- I've never eaten anything here that I didn't like! The ambience is also ideal for all occasions, making it a versatile and delightful venue for casual outings and formal celebrations alike! 

I do have mixed reviews about customer service, though. Servers tend to be very friendly and attentive, but I've had issues with the hosts/hostesses on more than one occasion. During my most recent visit, my (large) party and I arrived a few minutes before our reservation time. The hostess was very rude and dismissive of us upon our early arrival. Furthermore, she made no effort to try to seat us together, even though I had called the restaurant TWICE ahead of time to verify that they could accomomodate us. We ended up having to sit at two separate tables, although they did seat us near each other.","Dined on June 8, 2019",4,4,3,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The food was good but the portions are small and my dish should’ve included pasta or something in addition to mussels. I paid nearly $40 for one entree and left hungry.

I also thought the ambiance would be more lively considering the website boasts burlesque and aerial performances. 

The service was otherwise great.

There were four spiders at the table we were sat at and I noticed them just as we finished our appetizer. The spiders were nearly crawling on me and I have a bad phobia of spiders. I stood up to find the server for 5 minutes and finally had to go find her. Then she made us stand in the middle of the restaurant and someone else came and told us there wouldn’t be any seats for us anytime soon. We sat ourselves at a table in the bar area. The server had a very bad attitude and didn’t even so much as ask how she could make our experience better. She instead made us feel like we were such an inconvenience to her for asking to move. Service is terrible at this restaurant.,"Dined on May 19, 2019",1,3,1,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
This was an amazing experience and the food was awesome. Sat in the bar area and the bartender was awesome and so was the service. We are an older couple and were enjoying ourselves UNTIL the young manager came by and inquired if things were okay....basically insinuating that she thought we were fighting. We told her yes that we were having fun and she told me that was fine but she also told me to be civil. Being chastised by a presumptuous twenty something year old in a brutal way left a bad taste in my mouth!,"Dined on May 19, 2019",4,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"The food is fine but I do not see how it has over 4000 good reviews in yelp and I waited for almost one month to get the seat. The interior design is great and vibes was nice.

"The Pink Door has been one of my favorite restaurants for over 25 years.  However, at our last visit we noticed that things have changed.  What used to be a smart, funky, relaxing place to have a great meal has turned in to an upscale Applebees.  Overstuffed strollers were sitting next to tables as parents kept getting up and returning to attend to fussy babies.  Children spilled drinks on the floor and parents left it to the wait staff to clean up. The new addition is beautiful, but the extra space also seems to have created a less intimate feel and experience, which we always loved about the Pink Door. Thank goodness the food is still as delicious as ever, but we did leave disappointed, wondering if our experience was a sign of change, or just a bad night.","Dined on May 12, 2019",3,5,3,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Not many menu choices - I had spinach lasagne which was good but wished for some sausage or more flavor with spices.  Husband ordered ziti with meatballs - pretty standard fare but pricey at $19.  Appetizer of roasted garlic for $14 only had three very small pieces of dry, tough bread (not toasted or fresh) and small amount of spreadable cheese that tasted like cottage cheese - I don’t recommend it.  Atmosphere is fun, but don’t expect great food.","Dined on May 10, 2019",3,3,4,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Loved the Branzino and the arancini were perfect.... best I’ve had outside of Italy.  Our waiter didn’t get my wine right although he said it was rose’ it definitely was not.  It was a dry white.  Also it shouldn’t be considered odd to ask for a fresh fork for fish after you’ve used one for tomato based antipasti.  It’s a lovely restaurant not a diner and the wait staff should automatically change the cutlery . The bread is amazing... chewey and perfect .

"Nothing compares to the full experience you expect and receive while dining at the Pink Door on a Monday in the bar area. The food is always seasonal, always excellent and always freshly made from scratch farm to table perfect. And add to that the exotic, exhilarating and hypnotic aerial performance and you have a perfect night for dinner and entertainment. Perfect for every day, business, special occasions. The beauty of the place is the eclectic mix of everyone and everything. Fully inclusive intentionally to achieve a perfect mix of people, food, fun and harmony. And the price is surprisingly reasonable and an excellent value for the quality and quantity. The service is also intentionally eclectic and perfect as an entertaining backdrop to the full experience. Well done Pink Door. I never miss the chance to drop in when I’m in Seattle and you never let me down.","Dined on April 30, 2019",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Pink Door was open, we made reservations 28 days in advance. Wow Wow Wow was Pink Door worth the wait. The food-spectacular, ambiance-off the charts, light/decor-fun elegance with a hint of mid evil.

"Very beautiful restaurant! Very romantic too. We started out at the bar for drinks, which was great...good drinks and we got to watch the aerialist perform. Then we were seated in the dining room for dinner. Had a great view of water and the big wheel.  
We highly recommend everything we had:  started with the cheese board, *Amazing*! Their bread with that outstanding olive oil is so addicting!  We both thought the Caesar salad was also very delicious. For dinner, my husband had the Clams & Mussels, which was wonderful, and I had the spaghetti with fresh artichokes (can't remember exact name), which was very tasty.  We also heard the group at the very next table raving about Pink's famous lasagna, and the Paparadelle with Bolognese. 
For dessert, we HIGHLY recommend their doughnuts. SOOOO yummy. They are filled with a rhubarb cream filling, and come with a custardy type dipping sauce.  Absolutely delicious.
Lastly, the service was outstanding, both at bar and in dining room.  We had a wonderful evening and will definitely be back.","Dined on April 15, 2019",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

The cioppino was tasteless and didn’t have enough food.  The pastas were pretty good.  The bread served with dinner (both plain and garlic) were excellent.  We think they have the best French fries.

It is also a wonderful place to reconnect with old friends, It is cozy but spacious at the same time. You can have meaningful conversations and enjoy the artists that sing and perform. It has warm a feeling, the service is impeccable, and the food is just beautiful. It is the best place to  come in on a cold PNW day and cuddle up with a dish of the the best lasagna, ever.

The ambience was a nice surprise and the views were unexpected - especially considering how unobtrusive the entrance is.

"The food was excellent. Really utterly fantastic. In my experience this restaurant is among the top 3 Italian restaurants i’ve been to (in N. America). My wife and I lived in NYC for 12 years and we have high standards and expectations when dining at Italian restaurants. I had the halibut and wifey had the ragu pasta, and we shared the asparagus appetizer. Their olive oil concoction for the bread was outwardly. Never had I tasted anything like it. So, food-wise I give all the stars available. However the waitress wasn’t that keen on being nice to us. She wasn’t downright heartless, not by any means. Just a bit off-putting, unfriendly and rushing. Maybe she was having a bad day. It just felt like she didn’t want to work that day. Maybe it was us taking our time trying to savour the food. We took a bit more time especially because it was our anniversary. Maybe it was us being Asian and gay. I know for sure Seattle is LGBTQ friendly. Not that we expected any congrats but a bit more friendly manner would’ve been appreciated. However, we did get a cozy table in the corner by the windows that overlooked the market and Puget Sound. Dealing with tourists can be hard and gruelling. I know that because again I lived in NYC. Anyway, food-wise, I would love to visit again and taste other items on their menu. Hopefully we’ll get a different waitperson who won’t leave bitterness in our minds.","Dined on April 11, 2019",4,5,3,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"My train to see my son on his quick business trip to Seattle was two hours late and all I worried about was missing my anticipated dinner reservation at The Pink Door. When I finally arrived there straight from the all day train ride, the greeter whisked my luggage away, sat me next to my son at a table with a wonderful view of the water, brought me a glass of wine, and coached me to breathe. I then had a memorable dinner experience with excellent service and delicious food. For dinner I had grilled prawns over a Caesar salad and my son had the Rigatoni with meatballs. Dinner at the Pink Door is not just dinner. It's an immersion into a relaxing, cultured and nourishing time warp.

"My fiance and I loved the Pink Door!! It was so romantic and the food was delicious!! We got the cheese plate, the roasted garlic, the lasagna, and the creme brulee. Everything was wonderful, but the lasagna was amazing!! We sat in the dining room so we had a view, it wasn't crowded, and it was just so romantic. We had the best time!!","Dined on March 28, 2019",5,5,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"What an amazing spot! The staff was great, the food was top notch, the ambience was on point. We went on a Sunday and saw an aerial performance - WOW.  I had a friend advise I make reservations about a month so, so I could ensure we got in. We had a reservation for the bar, but we arrived earlier & they were able to put us at a table in the dining area with a beautiful view of the Water. And they let us know when the performer was about to start so we wouldn’t miss out. We did dress up, but not all the guests inside did. What a friggen fantastic experience!","Dined on March 25, 2019",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"Personally I found this place did not live up to the hype. For having to book reservations 5 weeks in advance I expected the food to be amazing and it left much to be desired. Could be my lack of traditional Italian restaurant experiences but was looking for more pasta options than three -- one of which was vegetarian. Would be nice to offer the lasagna with a meat sauce for the meat eaters who prefer meat with their meal. Unlikely we'll be back, good to try once but definitely did not live up to expectations.","Dined on March 25, 2019",3,3,4,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Food and service where both great. We were sat at a window table and it was an incredible view of the bay. Price was fair and average for nicer Italian dining. It was quite easy to find despite only being a pink door in the alley and I heard great things about it so we had to check it out.,"Dined on March 18, 2019",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

I have dined at the pink door for many years but when I went this weekend I had the worst service. My waiter was really rude and had a very bad attitude towards us but was being friendly to people at the table around us. It felt like she was trying to rush us and at one point she rolled her eyes at us while I was asking her for something. I didn’t have an attitude back or say anything to her but I did talk to the manager after and all he said was sorry.,"Dined on March 17, 2019",1,4,1,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"I hope other people don't read this review, as it's already hard to get a reservation. Service was awesome, the ambiance was perfect and the food was top notch. Do be aware that the portions on the pasta are very small, but the taste makes up for it. 

My only hesitation: there are three distinct spaces in the restaurant, the patio (seasonal), the back, and the front area with the bar. I dont think I'd enjoy sitting in the front area as it is much louder and much hotter than the rest of the restaurant, plus you don't get the views.","Dined on March 17, 2019",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"We really enjoyed our dinner here! The food was really excellent all around... we had the arincini, la fetunna, agnolotti, lasagna, and the cauliflower potato dish. For dessert we had the crime brûlée and the flourless chocolate cake. My husband ordered the starry starry night cocktail. The arincini was decent but not on the same level as the rest of the meal and I wasn’t a fan of the chocolate cake, but everything else was SPECTACULAR! Super delicious food that didn’t feel overly heavy for Italian food. We had a table right by the window with a view of the water and pike place, which made for such a great atmosphere! This is a place that I would definitely come back to for date night, or somewhere I would bring out of town guests.","Dined on March 17, 2019",4,4,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Hard to find the location as the door is more of a salmon pink color faded but the local homeless guy noticed we were lost and pointed us in the right direction.  You will need reservations.  I felt a little under dresssd for dinner in a tee shirt. My bad for not changing in to a coller shirt for dinner.  The quail was the best I ever had.  Our waitress knew her stuff and made the whole experience pleasant.  This place is now on my list of places to eat when in Seattle.,"Dined on March 15, 2019",5,5,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Loved it! The best lasagne I've ever had. I've had spinach lasagne before, but never spinach lasagne noodles. With 3 sauces - a white sauce, pesto, and seriously the freshest, sweetest, best tomato sauce I've ever had. My date had the antipasto platter which was huge and more than he could eat, and consisted of many sections of deliciousness. All the veggies were flavored and cooked to perfection...nothing overcooked or overflavored. Ambience is whimsical and unique. Really enjoyed the experience and we'll be back for sure on our next trip to Seattle.","Dined on March 13, 2019",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"My experience was great, the ambiance was wonderful, I had made a reservation the night before and didn’t realize I reserved for the wrong area, but I had left comments on where I wanted to sit, so they understood the mishap and were very accommodating. The food was fabulous, again the dining ambiance was just as great as the lounge, our waiter seemed very friendly. Towards the end of the night it felt like we were more of a bother and that we were a hindrance. It was my birthday and I had wanted a dessert, I thought it was one thing instead of another... so when they brought it out I had stopped the waiter to let the waiter know and he offered a different desert but it was late I said no, and he didn’t even offer to take it off the check. Since we didn’t even eat it... but when he dropped the check my husband just decided to eat it since we already paid for it. I don’t believe they did any thing wrong. It was just not an above and beyond customer service situation. So that was a bit of a bummer. Otherwise it was a great place and I would definitely recommend it to a friend!","Dined on March 11, 2019",4,5,3,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

We loved it and plan to come back!","Dined on March 10, 2019",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
The food and service was excellent however when I ordered a Coca Cola it came in an extremely dirty glass. I didn't notice until I finished drinking my soda. It became apparent I was drinking out of a nasty glass with black residue on the sides. It made me feel disgusted. I would not go back to this restaurant because they use dirty dishes.

"Our experience at the Pink Door was not what was expected at all.  First of all, I called and was told that there would be entertainment that we could enjoy while dining...that it would be an experience to remember (by the way, this is part of their advertising).  It was not!!  We were going there for a birthday celebration and were seated in the back of the restaurant away from the nightly entertainment.  The food was sub-par and the service was not that great either.   The server did not come over to see if we needed anything else and I had to remind them that it was a birthday celebration.  I was told that they would come to the table and sing along....did not!  I was beyond disappointed with the entire experience and would not recommend this restaurant at all.","Dined on March 9, 2019",1,1,1,1,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"I loved their entrance. The idea that there is no name plate & you have to guess the location from its name ( you have to search for a pink door when you reach the location & that's where you have to enter) is so unique. I am a vegetarian, there are not much vegetarian options there but the ones which are there are just too delicious. The Roasted Garlic & the ARANCINI is something which I had tasted for the first time, the portion is a bit less but its just worth even if you feel you are spending a bit more. In the main course the Lasagna is the best I had till date, it just melts in your mouth. The view of ferris wheel from the restraurent is cherry on the cake. One of the cutest places with a very good food I have ever been.","Dined on March 5, 2019",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The new menu is boring. There is nothing that excites the palate. I loved their braised rabbit but that is gone and replaced with a sausage stuffed quail. The pork shank was plated nicely but it is essentially a bone with very little meat paired with a few sample bites of ""this and that"". No thank you. I'll wait to see what the next menu change brings. Hopefully we will be surprised. Otherwise the ambiance of this place is amazing.

"Pink Door is my favorite restaurant in Seattle. It continues to be innovative in its Italian offerings (with a Pacific Northwest spin), as well as providing near perfect service. On this visit, we had a late lunch (starting at 2 pm, lasting till 4 pm) that included a delicious mushroom risotto for me and squid-ink black pasta with seafood for my husband. We both loved our dishes. Cocktail and wine selections were great, as were the salads following the main dish. Since it was a late Monday afternoon, the restaurant was very quiet, unhurried, letting us enjoy the fabulous view on a rare sunny February day. Lovely time--great food, great service, great view.","Dined on February 26, 2019",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

The food was terrible as was the service. the music was loud and then low but whoever was controlling the music either had a hearing problem or didn't know how to keep the volume on a steady level.,"Dined on February 24, 2019",1,1,1,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"The ambiance was very special. The lighting and decor was very intimate. The view of the sound and the lighted Ferris Wheel was amazing. We were celebrating my mom’s birthday, and while the service was good in general, I was surprised that they did not do anything or offer to do something in celebration of the birthday. The food was excellent and everything we tried was amazing. The roasted garlic was very addictive, the beet and arugula salad is a must try. The pink door lasagna was very tasty and the pappardelle al Ragù Bolognese was out of this world. The grilled fish of the day was well seasoned and cooked perfectly, and the presentation was really appealing to the eye. The seasoned fries with the fried rosemary and aioli was the best I had anywhere  
We enjoyed our dinner at the Pink Door and will definitely come back","Dined on February 23, 2019",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

My wife had clams and mussels one day and fish the other.  All were fantastic.  We also had grilled garlic bread one day, a very nice addition to wonderful salads 

It’s hard to get reservations but they do save some tables for walk-ins.  If you really want to try but can’t get reservations, be there right at 11:30 when they open; or prepare to wait.","Dined on February 16, 2019",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"While most restaurants were closed during a State Emergency (Feb,2019), the Pink Door was open. The staff was amazing and knowledgeable of the menu. The ahi tuna, as recommended by our waiter, was superb. The Osso Bucco was cooked to perfection and favourable. After dinner we moved to the bar and enjoyed the live entertainment. I highly recommend going to the Pink Door while in Seattle.

"Due to the unforeseen conditions, such as snow and uber drivers not being redeably available we were 7 minutes late to our reservation. I immediately apologized, and I informed the hostess I was late. A manager, I believe... abruptly interrupted and told me my table was given away and refused service. In dismay, I was only 7 mins late. It’s snowing and the road is closed due to snow. After, 10 minutes we were finally seated. I was so disappointed, I planned my reservation in advance knowing I was coming out of state. Also, celebrating my birthday. The only reason they are getting 3 stars, is because the food was delicious. Service was horrible and I’m really torn on recommending this place to anyone.","Dined on February 10, 2019",3,4,3,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"My husband, teenage daughter, her friend and I went for dinner and caught the aerialist act on Monday first seating.  It is such a lovely spot with warm and interesting décor that is lost in the new restaurants that spring up weekly in Seattle. The girls thought the place was ""fancy"" and hopefully had the same memorable experience as I did when I first visited the pink door back when I was in high school.  The food and beverages where great.  My only regret is that I am now gluten free and have fond memories of the roasted garlic and gorgonzola spread on crusty bread that I had in my 20s.  They do offer GF bread but I didn't try it.  I did have the GF pasta substituted in which was fine though I think the penne shape doesn't lend itself as well to a linguine dish.    The service was great and the PG aerialist show was impressive.  I was also pleasantly surprised to see that there is a HUGE addition since I was there last.  The restaurant now spans from the Post Alley to Pike Pl. with views overlooking the sound.  I only peeked my head into the new dining room but will definitely return for a date night.","Dined on February 5, 2019",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"We started with cheese board and garlic bread. Both were delicious and interesting. For main course I had the steak, my partner had pork. Both were excellent. I wasn’t in love with the cauliflower based side for he steak, a little sweet, but that’s probably just a personal preference. The desserts were less great. My partners orange cake was very orangey (yeah it’s an orange cake but the flavor was a little overpowering for me) and was a little dry. The maple creme brûlée “custard” was a little too cold for me though very tasty. My main gripe was the service. Our server was very polite when speaking with us but seemed incredibly rushed, making me feel almost a nuisance. For our main course, she took my partners main dish order, then mine, and rushed off without asking if we wanted sides, which we did, but were unable to order as the server did not return until after our dishes had arrived. When ordering dessert our server took my partner’s order and was rushing away without asking for my order. I called it out to her as she walked away but was unable to squeeze my coffee order into the split second of attention I was afforded. 

In summary, the food was good but considering the price we paid for dinner (+$200) for two people, I’d expect to be treated more like the most important element of the evening rather than an inconvenience.","Dined on February 2, 2019",3,3,3,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Our server reminded us every 10 minutes that they were closing soon.  He continued to rush us through every step, rolled his eyes when we didn't know what we wanted, and was in such a hurry that when he popped our bottle of wine the cork hit me in the chest. 

My pasta arrived cold and after it arrived we were informed that the kitchen was closed..... yet as I ate my sad cold pasta,  i watched other guests receiving food,  more bread, and more drinks.   One table even received a dessert with a candle...i assume for a birthday. 

My date told the server twice that it was my birthday and he just said ""oh cool"".

We ordered the cheese board deluxe and it was fantastic. Well worth the money spent. 

I order a jack & Coke, while my girlfriend ordered a Tito’s with ginger ale. 

I ordered a rigatoni entree and it was barely enough to feed a small child. My girlfriend ordered the linguine and to no surprise the dish was small. 

After leaving the restaurant I spent about $100. Very disappointed with the portion size for the main entree.

"When I made the reservation I said one person was in a wheelchair and we were celebrating a birthday. When we got to the restaurant, the first thing we see is a threshold a wheelchair cannot go over and a flight of stairs going down. . . plus a hostess that was not friendly or not trying to help the situation. I told her what the reservation said and she ignored me. Plus nothing was said or done for the birthday celebration.
BUT our server was friendly and her service was great. Plus the food and drinks were very good.","Dined on January 16, 2019",4,5,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Literally can't say enough fabulous things about The Pink Door. The ambiance is incredible. The food is out of this world. And the service was lovely. I highly recommend the roasted garlic as an appetizer - my husband and I both agreed we probably could've just gotten a few of those and stuffed ourselves. I chose the lasagna because it is incredibly rare to find one that is meatless and my husband had rigatoni with meatballs. Both of us were pleased with the freshness and authenticity of our meals. If we have the pleasure of returning, I hope to make a reservation in the part of the restaurant where we can watch the cabaret show which looked like a real treat!","Dined on December 31, 2018",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"We were seated by the window facing pike market and the water, which was fantastic! The lighting and candles in the room were nicely adjusted.
Food wise it was kind of mediocre. We actually liked trout which was the fish of the day.  However, there was too few choices on the menu. Maybe the appetizers and desserts were just not cater to our taste.","Dined on December 31, 2018",4,3,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"This was our second visit and (like the first), it was fab! The menu suited all 4 guests, (and I have dairy/gluten sensitivities). The food is beautifully presented and very tasty - the tuna appetizer is delicious, and the roasted garlic - fantastic. Our main courses, again, were very flavorful... linguine with clams, trout, and Branzino Style white fish... amazing!
Lola, who was our server/adviser for the evening is wonderful, very engaging, funny, amiable and wonderfully professional... attentive but not intrusive...
There was no rushing us out of the door and we enjoyed a great evening.

"I made a reservation for my friend's and I to eat here for my birthday. We arrived 15-20 mins late and I had told them that that would be the case. We were placed in the lounge area instead of the dining area (which was fine; it was cozy) and were given a different menu, which barely had any options (this is the part which made me very disappointed). I didn't end up liking any of the food options so I asked the server if I could possibly substitute the pasta sauce from marinara to white sauce instead. She said yes and said she would also bring meatballs on the side. The pasta was brought out with very little cream sauce and was a very small serving.  I thought I would be paying about $21 which was the price of the dish, but turns out when I look at the check it was $38. I checked and the 3 pieces of meatballs were $13. The truth is I didn't like them so much that I couldn't even finish 1 meatball. The pasta itself was fine but it was definitely not worth $20. The customer service was very poor as well for our server didn't bother to mention the case if I did replace the sauce. I was not given much information. lIt definitely would have been fine if I was told but I was definitely not aware.","Dined on December 20, 2018",2,1,1,1,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"One of my favorite Italian restaurants. Consistently a wonderful experience. Service, food, ambiance are all 5 star experiences every time I go.
Favorite foods: 
-Linguine Alle Vongole: Food is fresh, simple, with a clean taste. My bf orders this dish practically at every italian restaurant. The Pink Door does it the best. The simple garlic and white wine sauce with pancetta is delicious and great for dipping bread into (: 
-Cioppino Pink Door: I love the spicy tomato and white wine broth the seafood is simmered in. Also another great sauce to dip bread into and eat.
-Fresh Oyster starter: always fresh and delicious, especially with a little of the pink balsamico ice with each bite.
-Bagna Cauda: We love anchovies and garlic, so this was a winner. The fresh vegetables are great, but dipping bread into this hot bath of goodness was amazing. It is steaming hot and a bit salty.

Service+ Ambiance: We always go here to celebrate birthdays and anniversaries for a little romantic date, but the pink door is great for groups as well. It can get a little loud, but its a fun, energetic vibe. Service is always on point, servers know the menu and can suggest great wine pairings.

There is so much to this gem of a restaurant! Definitely try it for yourself. (:","Dined on December 17, 2018",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

The Chicken Marsala was great and the scallops good.  The service was spotty.  We only had one fork for the oysters with two people eating.  We had to ask for water.  We ordered a split of Pinot Noir but were poured and charged for a full bottle.  The waitress knew that it was my wife's birthday and said ""Happy Birthday"" but offered no comp cupcake.  For the amount of money charged I expected more.  We have been there many times and this was always a standout.

"Let me start by saying that the Pink Door is NOT impossible to find if you follow directions well, either from the website or GPS. We found it first time out. We liked the fact that it doesn't have to advertise its existence with a giant sign or gaudy neon. This restaurant is somewhat like the door out front -- simply stated. It's everything you could want for a cozy, delicious dinner on a chilly November night in Seattle. We had reservations, which are highly recommended. The service was great, only to be outdone by the food and drink. We had the Pink Door Caesar Salad with Shrimp and the Rigatoni & Grilled Italian Sausage with Marinara Sauce. We started with a glass of craft beer and the Chianti Ruffina, followed by an order of the Tuscan Fries. ALL the food was extremely fresh and beyond tasty.

"Pink Door is one of those special experiences that you have every few years, if you're lucky. One of those hidden gems that you just happen to stumble upon- encountering a buzzing, musical hub down a flight of stairs. I felt like I was walking into a Speakeasy. It was wonderful and the food seemed to be cooked by a fleet of Nonnas. Cannot recommend highly enough- the lasagne, the handcrafted cocktails, the swelling, uptempo music, it was amazing and purely memorable. Less about filling your tummy, and more about a fantastic experience. Highly recommend going at night.","Dined on November 8, 2018",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The entertainment was awesome! We went on a Sunday night (when the aerialist performs), and were very impressed by her talent. It's not often you get to watch a trapeze act inches from your table in a dimly lit, cozy Italian restaurant. That being said, the food was only fair. It wasn't bad by any means, but I was expecting much better things out of the kitchen based on the price tag of the meals. The meals were also pretty small portion sizes. My husband is 6'9"" and consumes a lot of calories a day, and he ate two whole baskets of bread in addition to the meal and left hungry. (This might be a special case, but I did feel cheated on the amount of food for the money.)  All in all, you're paying for the entertainment and the ambiance of the place, which was superb and well worth it.","Dined on November 5, 2018",4,2,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Everyone raves about pink door. It’s cute, hidden and a nice little Italian spot, but nothing so memorable or insane that I’d die to go back. They do shows (burlesque) and so not knowing this and seeing a line down the alley to get it, I was a bit confused. We did get to skip that line, but no one tells you this. Because a show was going on we were seated in the very far back. It was freezing inside the restaurant- we asked for them to look into it because everyone was wearing their parkas. Overall the food was ok and I didn’t see the show or wasn’t even told about it and offered to buy a ticket- wish they had said something.","Dined on November 4, 2018",4,4,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

The hostess was very polite and told us they were very booked and we would likely have to wait. Not their fault so we were 100% okay waiting. About 7 minutes later the hostess said that some people didn’t show and we could be seated early. Such a nice gesture.

Order was taken by one staff, meal was served by another.  Came in at 3 pm, not very busy, but the meal server never came back to our table with another knife she said she would since she dropped the first one.  And she never came back to serve us bread as requested nor to check on us.  Have to ask the busboy for a spoon.  Papadelle al ragu was served cold...bleh!

Not very disability friendly. I have a autoimmune disease and those stairs killed me. The food was great but hurt my stomach some as the noodles were drowning in oil. I asked if it was normal and the waitress said it was supposed to be that greasy. UGH! It was fun over all tho! :) Wish we had found a better access to the place. I know it is supposed to be charming and hidden but it was hard on my legs. Plus there was no place to sit and wait. Had 9pm reservations and we got seated at 9:45pm . Worth the experience at least once. But don't expect it to be fine dining because it just is not.,"Dined on October 20, 2018",2,3,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The Pink Door itself is really closer to melon color.  Anyway, you find this door without a sign and wonder what is on the other side.  Down a flight of stairs, then through several large seating/lounge/areas.  We were seated in the large back room which overlooks part of the Pike Place Market, bright and cheery.

Despite living in Seattle for over 30 years, this was our first visit.  We chose a mid-day lunch and were treated to excellent service and very good food.  We had the antipasti plate, and an eggplant panini.  Both were so tasty and fresh.

We did arrive a little early (11:45) just enough to be ahead of the very busy lunch crowd.","Dined on October 10, 2018",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"I simply love The Pink Door. Yes, it's changed its layout. There's a causal dining area, a more formal dining area, the patio, and the bar. Hey, it's all great--and now there are even more choices of what ambiance one might want during the meal. For this time at the Pink Door, we sat in the formal dining area by the window. It was a lunch celebration for my husband (just the two of us). We love slow lunches as one might have in Italy, and Pink Door always accommodates that easy meal with lots of great dishes and drinks. For the main, I had a succulent halibut. Perfectly cooked. We ordered a side of roasted cauliflower. Had a lovely chocolate dessert. Wonderful. The full meal can be pricey but reasonable for Seattle prices for that kind of meal. Can't wait to go back in December for our annual holiday meal with extended family.","Dined on October 7, 2018",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Only concrete plans for my visit to Seattle, were for the Pink Door, based on all the positive reviews online. I wish I could say my anticipation and excitement matched my actual experience there. Servers and food were GREAT!! Management and bar staff were rude to say the least and for some reason disliked our table and let us know they didn’t like us. Four almost 40 year old women, enjoying a nice dinner and a few cocktails, paid our bill, tipped well..... but were yelled at and cut off by the bartender. The dancing, loud bachelorette party behind us was ok, but us four talking amongst ourselves were an issue for the staff.

The food was excellent and the Lasagna was excellent as usual. Service was great. The only blemish is that when we've dine an many top line restaurants and I make reservation for a very special event like a 60th Bday, we've always been presented a small cake, coffee or something to end the night. It's always a very classy touch. We didn't see our server once the bill was laid down. Missed opportunity.

We were greeted and provided with specials by our friendly server.  
She brought us complimentary glasses of prosecco for our anniversary. 
The grilled octopus was tasty and well seasoned. Not the most tender octopus I have ever had but still very good. 
We shared the summer risotto next. Perfectly seasoned.  Anise was the predominant flavor. Still delicious and creamy with very fresh crab. 
The cioppino was tasty. The broth was similar to a minestrone. The seafood was just a touch overcooked.
Overall a very lovely meal.  Excellent service.","Dined on September 16, 2018",4,4,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"This restaurant is all about interiors. The ambiance was intimate and good for dates especially if you are seated near the front where they have live music. At the back of the restaurant offers a great view. The food was okay or below average. Ordered Linguine but it was undercooked and too salty for me. Offers only a handful of dessert menu so not a lot of options especially for dessert lovers and with sweet tooth like me. Would i recommend this for a date? Yes. But for food quality and service, my apologies but no.","Dined on September 15, 2018",2,1,2,2,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Our first time in Seattle & any time I researched places to go for dinner, this spot popped up! An awesome (and kind of hidden!) joint on the very cool Post Alley, and the restaurant is really pretty inside & way bigger than I expected. We started with the octopus (yum) and got entrees we both loved (mine was the mixed seafood -- forget the name) and my boyfriend got the rabbit. Both really great dishes -- my only negative comment would be that my portion felt a bit small.  Would definitely recommend & go back to try other things here!","Dined on September 13, 2018",4,4,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"Highly recommend their garlic bread for the extra $6 - it was delicious!!  The ahi tuna app was awesome as well.  The food was very good, but be prepared for an extremely limited protein menu.  When we visited there was only one fish dish (they were not offering the branzino style that night), one beef, one pork and one rabbit dish.  No chicken.  So if you’re looking for pasta you’re in the right place.","Dined on September 13, 2018",4,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Every time I dine at Pink Door I think it can’t get better. Whenever my friend visits from out of town and his mom stays in Seattle to visit with him I take a week day off we do lunch at here. We arrived about 20 minutes early our noon reservation but were still seated immediately outside as requested. If you haven’t dine outside at Pink Door it’s a must. We had a wonderful leisurely lunch with excellent service. We shared the tuna crudo as an appetizer so refreshing the citrus of the orange paired so beautifully with the tuna. My friend had the lasagna which os a very generous serving he ended up taking half of it home. His mom had the clam linguini she us unable to eat garlic due to health reasons and they easily accommodated. I had the Springtime Risotto sometimes it can be prepared to rich this was perfect and didn’t feel heavy at all the Dungeness crab was quite a treat and the fresh corn added texture and brightness to the dish. Can’t wait to dine here again soon,"Dined on September 6, 2018",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"Good food, great service. Was a bit disappointed that the fish of the day was scallops, rather than a whole fish. The Bruschetta was excellent with fresh tomato slices and basil on cibatta. We also had meatballs and fresh baby carrots which were wonderful. The risotto topped with a small amount of crabmeat, was mixed with golden corn, which detracted from the dish. So while tasty, I would not order again as it was more creamed corn, than risotto. The view from the dining room overlooking Pike Market was lovely. The service from the time we arrived to when we left was excellent. I recommend this restaurant, but make sure you understand how the dishes are prepared.","Dined on September 5, 2018",5,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"We went to the Pink Door, in September, on our way to Hawaii vacation.  Took a lay-over of 11 hrs, and because of Open Table reviews, we chose it.  They were right!  We LOVED this restaurant! Anna A. was our server and she was wonderful.  Food is amazing and the upper terrace is a great place to eat and see the scenery.  They were very friendly and welcoming, as we told them it was our first time in Seattle, WA.  I told my husband I want to go back just to eat there again.  It is a perfect place that caters to adult and children (please, that does not mean to let them run around).  We went with our son and he loved the place, we had to walk all over to see it.   It is priced reasonably - we planned and saved for this vacation, and had a great time in Seattle.  We went to the restaurant after visiting the Space Needle and running around down town.","Dined on September 5, 2018",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"I have been to the Pink Door before so I knew what to expect. The food was great as usual. It was really packed for a Tuesday night. We got there about 10 minutes early and they told us they were running true to schedule and they would come get us at 8:45. When 8:45 came along I hadn't seen anyone and was worried they missed us. I walked up to the front and saw the person that I originally talked to. She was walking back and forth and helping others. I was hoping she would see me off to the side, but she didn't say anything to me at all even though she saw me. Luckily another person was there and he said to her ""I think this gentleman may have got a text"". I did not hear ""text"" so I had to ask him to repeat himself. Once i heard him I said, I did not and didn't even know i was supposed to. He told me no worries and got some menus and told me to follow him. I let him know the rest of my party was over by the bar and he followed me over. He sat us down gave us our menus. Great service on his part. We came there specifically for one dish. The pappardelle with  bolognese. I order the Dungeness crab risotto and it was fantastic.","Dined on August 29, 2018",5,5,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Anniversary,"Dined on August 23, 2018",5,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"We celebrated mutual anniversaries with friends at the Pink Door and found it to be lively, charming and elegant (depending on where you’re seated.) We were seated in the back dining Room overlooking Elliott Bay which is a little less hectic than the front dining room where you enter. 
I enjoyed the taper candles dripping onto silver holders as well as the chandeliers and overall golden glow that bathed the room. 
We shared the antipasto platter which was more than enough for four to share which was delicious: they have quite a way with vegetables here: caponata, tapenade, zucchini, peppers, etc. were superb. We also shared a roasted cauliflower side dish that was so savory and flavorful it converted a sworn cauliflower hater in our group. We had the lasagna (fresh and light), the halibut special (slightly smoky from the grill) which were delicious. The corn and crab risotto was bland (in my opinion) and the undercooked rigatoni had scorched spicy sausage with it, so there were some hits and misses. The ice cream trio was delightful with the honey flavor being the winner as was the Pavlova dessert.
All in all, it was an extremely enjoyable evening and what one person didn’t like, someone else did, so we didn’t leave unsatisfied. Staff overall were very pleasant and accommodating but could use a little more training in basic culinary terms and ingredients. Still, we would all recommend a stop at the Pink Door.","Dined on August 23, 2018",4,4,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Overall, my friend and I had a pleasant experience at The Pink Door. I've had friends and family who've dined here during their trips to Seattle and have heard great things about their pasta. I had their popular dish, Linguine Alle Vongole, and my friend ordered their Pink Door lasagne. While both dishes were delicious, I would recommend the Linguine Alle Vongole as it is more unique and worth the price. Despite reserving a table a month prior to our trip and requesting to sit indoors by the windows, we ended up having to wait around 15 minutes and were eventually seated outdoors at the Patio. While that was not a major issue (and the staff were quite accommodating), there were only 3 chairs for waiting guests, which left us awkwardly standing there. However despite this, it was a nice meal to wrap up our Seattle trip.","Dined on August 18, 2018",4,4,3,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The Pink Door is an experience more in atmosphere than food. It was a unique, hard-to-find place tucked away in an alley near Pike's Market. A friend recommended it, and it was so busy that we could only make reservations for lunch. 
We sat outside at the quaint little table covered in a pretty pink oilcloth table cloth. First we shared a cheese plate, which was good, but nothing more than you could find at the grocery store.
Unfortunately the food went downhill from there. My lunch was cold and tasted like a warmed-up freezer meal. 
My husband liked his food, but I opted to eat the bread instead of my entree.","Dined on August 17, 2018",3,2,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"The Pink Door was the perfect waterfront restaurant destination! From its tucked away location in Seattle’s downtown alleyways to its no name designation on the restaurant front. You feel as though you’re entering a secret destination that only a select few are lucky enough to be in the know of.  The interior was eclectic yet whimsical and the food and spirits were out of this world...beautiful and delicious at the same time. If you’re in the Seattle area the Pink Door is an absolute MUST!! (Ask for a seat on the patio or if the weather is gloomy, a seat by the window) ENJOY!","Dined on August 16, 2018",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"Attentive & knowledgable server. Started w/ the Tuna Crudo, so good we could have licked the plate. Followed by the Corn & Dungeness Crab Risotto and Linguine Vongole, both A+.

"Got to our lunch about 30 minutes early & we offered to sit at bar til reservation time. We were pleasantly surprised when they seated us right away. 
Wait staff was extremely attentive - our water glasses were never less than half full. 
Unfortunately didn’t get the name of our server, but she was super efficient & very helpful with our questions on the menu. 
Great window table with view of the water & Pike Market.  We stayed a little over 2 hours enjoying the view and food & never felt rushed. 
Would love coming here again on our next trip!","Dined on August 16, 2018",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Excellent! We made our reservation 3 weeks before our planned trip to Seattle.  We started with the grilled octopus appetizer which was the best I ever had. My husband and I shared it and it was plenty for the two of us. I had the Pink Door Lasagna, reputed to be what they are known for (by the staff), and it was fabulous! My husband had linguine with  meatballs and sausage that was wonderful-the sauce was excellent, sausage  (was a little spicy) and meatballs were great!  Fun atmosphere, if we are in Seattle again we will definitely have dinner at The Pink Door.","Dined on August 13, 2018",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"This is a restaurant you’d never find if you didn’t know it was there.  It’s very close to the Pike Street Market but down an ‘alley’ that has other restaurants and shops.  Even though it’s called the Pink Door, the door is really more of a peach color, so you’re not sure if you’ve arrived (there is no sign).  Once inside it’s this gigantic restaurant with different rooms and an eclectic design.  We were lucky enough to be seated all the way in the back, which happens to look out on the water and a little park next to the Market.  The food was delicious, the service was very good, and the view was wonderful.  I would highly recommend you find your way to this place if you are in Seattle and maybe request that you’re seated near the window so you can have the same view.","Dined on July 31, 2018",5,5,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Staff was great and informative. They never left my wife and I without water. In regards to the specials our waiter was versed in the preparation and presentation of the dishes. The decor was “ok” outside as In laminate table cloths. Inside was proper and decorated with great fixtures.

Food: I ordered the pappardelle and the wife ordered the risotto. Great flavors and excellent presentation. The first bite made me reminisce of my time in Italy. Fresh, flavorful, and great depth of flavors.

Drink: I ordered he house wine. It tasted like house wine. The carfe was dirty but that mattered not as I’m sure they dishwashers it and no one checked the cleanliness of it. Why complain when everything else was great. 

View: the shades were pulled down so we couldn’t see anything. However, it Protected is from the sun so worth it.","Dined on July 26, 2018",5,5,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

i would go back again to try more variety on the menu.
i shared a dish with another person in my group & the portions were placed on two separate plates which i thought was extremely thoughtful.   classy but casual environment. thank you!","Dined on July 26, 2018",4,4,4,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"I can’t say enough good things about this restaurant! My boyfriend and I were visiting from out of town for our anniversary and looking for a nice romantic spot for dinner. We were so busy doing excursions during the day that we weren’t ready to get dinner until after 9pm. I thought for sure it would be hard to find a nice place open late on a Monday night but The Pink Door didn’t disappoint. They were open until 11:30pm so it worked out perfectly. It was a little difficult to find as the entrance is in Post Alley. The door is pink (of course) so that was a dead giveaway. The dimly lit, intimate ambiance is that of Italian old world romance...perfect for a dinner date, or in our case, anniversary. We requested to sit inside and were seated in the back of the restaurant, which had a beautiful scenic views close to the waterfront. We started by ordering a few cocktails, which took a little while to be delivered. Our server was extremely apologetic and offered to take them off our bill without us even saying anything. This was jut the beginning of our impeccable service, David L. was a fantastic and extremely attentive server. One of the best I have had. We ordered the La Fettunta, Insalata Caprese, Piatto di Prosciutto as starters to share. I had the Lasagna Pink Door and my boyfriend had the Pappardelle al Ragu Bolognese. They were both fantastic, and his dish was with freshly made pasta! Finally, for dessert we shared the Perugina flourless chocolate cake with Campari Pomegranite sauce. It was amazing! My boyfriend doesn’t really eat chocolate and even he was blown away. Everything from start to finish completely exceeeded all expectations. I can see why they have a 4.7 on Google. It is a little pricey to eat there often but it was certainly worth every penny. We will definitely dine here again if we visit Seattle, such a special experience. My only complaint was that we missed the trapeze show in the lounge...a must see for our next time!","Dined on July 24, 2018",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"It was a wonderful experience, first time going to a restaurant which doesn’t have any sign of their name , only a pink door which signifies its presence 
Heard from one of the girls who work there about the background story It seems that this restaurant has been here from 1980s and the owner spent all her money on this place and had a neon sign for the name of the restaurant, but the city said you cannot have one , so on principle she decided not to have any signs only the door which is pink. 
Our waiter was Andrew and he took care of us very nicely 
Couple of pointers , there is no special veg menu , it’s two pastas in the general menu and if you want a vegan pasta there is one but not on menu 
We had a special occasion and they gave us a nice small champagne 
We had the lasagna, the owners mothers secret recipe and a pasta which was delicious

"The restaurant itself was great (nothing to complain about there) and food was great, however only comment I have is the sub-par table reservation system. OpenTable, if there is a way where someone reserving a table at Pink Door could see the full availability of party size AND time availability by date, that would make searching for a table less of a mystery. I originally tried to find a table for 5 during dinner time (6pm), but I didn't know if I messed with the dinner time and party size, I can potentially get something closer to the day I want. It forces the user to basically play a game of investigation to find a reservation versus being offered Pink Doors full availability at a glance.","Dined on July 7, 2018",4,4,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

I did not like this place at all. The food was not good. We found a hair in our food. Our server suggested random items and vouched for it and they were just awful. Even though we did not like it we still had to pay. It was a waste of money and time. The reviews that are posted about this place are way too good for a place like this that offers bland food.,"Dined on July 6, 2018",2,1,2,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Not easy to find as there is only a very small.sign by the large pink door.  Upper post alley.  Worth the search. Outside patio is great.   Service was average...expected a little bit more conversation as we had some questions.  Waiter said they didn't do GF paninis.  I questioned that, he checked, they do. I shouldn't have to know the menu better than the waitstaff. Slow to refill drinks.  Heavy Italian influence on the food, but very well done. Desserts are awesome. Save room.","Dined on July 4, 2018",4,5,3,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Excellent as always. We started with bruschetta made with thick slices of heirloom tomatoes and garlic on toasted rounds. The shrimp scampi is very good value- a tray of large sauteed prawns in s butter, citrus and basil sauce. Add a side veggie dish such ss potatoes and greens or grilled asparagus sprinkled generously with soft cheese. Use bread to soak up the delectable juices. Finish off with strawberry pavlova snd try not to moan in delight. Our cocktail: from out lips to your lips- prosecco, rose water and liquor- absolutely amazing!! Our server was so thoughtful and attentive, never far away when needed. It was my frirnd's birthday and dessert came with a lit candle. Memorable! Kudos to the highly skilled and talented chef and his team. Third time back in three months and worth the flight!","Dined on July 1, 2018",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Our waiter, David, was EXCELLENT (knowledgeable, welcoming, and attentive), the food was delicious and the view was textbook Seattle.

"This was a fun place to eat enhanced by the talented and VERY fit aerial artist performing overhead in the dining room while we ate.  The anti-pasta appetizer was delicious and plenty to share with 2 - 3 people.  The halibut special was tasty but the portion not overly generous.  While our waitress was nice enough she wasn't very experienced or well-trained.  There are a number of things she didn't know so she said she'd have to go ask but never came back with the answer.  The more concerning point was when we ordered a specific bottle of wine that we're familiar with.  She brought out the bottle and fortunately we saw that the label wasn't what we requested.  She insisted it was the same thing, which it wasn't (we just drank the same wine the night before).  As it turns out, the bottle she first brought was about $100 a bottle, more than half of the one we ordered.  Since she was unfamiliar with other things related to our dinner order this may have been an innocent oversight; we'll give her the benefit of the doubt.
This restaurant was pricey (especially for the wine even when you get the one you expect) but overall the food was good. I'd  recommend this restaurant but make sure to get reservations well in advance.","Dined on June 27, 2018",4,4,2,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

My first time at this place. I was visiting from out of the state and made reservations 3 weeks in advance. I was so excited based on the amazing reviews. Ambiance was amazing. BUT make sure you specify if you want to sit outside or inside when you reserve. They placed me in the back corner outside. My server was not friendly she wasn’t very helpful and she just rushed with me. My dinner was terrible. Way over priced. The peas were hard! Not even cooked. I told the server and she questioned/doubted me. Such a waste.

"This is one of our favorite local places.  We chose it to celebrate our oldest son's graduation from high school.  I booked the reservation 30 days in advance and felt like we had the worst table in the place.  It was out on the patio (90 degree day), right in the sun and we all were sweating through our meal.  When we asked about relocating inside, we were told the A/C had broken that morning and inside was no better.  The service and food were great but the experience was truly hindered by the heat.  I would have rather waited to get a shady table than to be placed in the sun.  Disappointed.","Dined on June 19, 2018",2,4,4,2,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"We're at Pink Door a few times each year, with our favorite being late summer - when the heirloom tomatoes are available and the Caprese salad is on the menu (worth lining up for). June is too early for that, but no worries. Spring greens risotto and the classic meatball sub did just fine.  If you've never had meatballs at Pink Door, stop depriving yourselves: you can get them with pasta or on the side, but the sub is how meatball subs should be made: ciabatta roll hollowed out with some marinara to dip in case what was on the sub was insufficient.  Add a half carafe of house red (always good), and take the rest of the day off...","Dined on June 18, 2018",5,5,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"My daughter had been to the Pink Door while in Seattle during a convention a year or two ago and raved about it. Her raves were more than justified. We were there celebrating Father's Day. The food was outstanding. Very fresh tasting and well prepared. The Calamari was outstanding and the lasagna melted in your mouth and was full of flavor. 
I would highly recommend this restaurant.

"Our experience at The Pink Door was jaw-dropping!  From the surprise of finding a quiet little pink door in Post Alley, then opening it to a busy bee-hive of activity down a lovely flight of stairs, and on to our cute little table on the deck with the very attentive wait staff, and finally to the delightfully delicious and awesomely attractive food prepared just for us - our mouths were agape and happy little gasps came out at each of the aforementioned points!  We HIGHLY recommend the Everything Green Salad (so beautiful in the shape of a pretty green rose, and tasty with fresh just right texture in every bite!), and the top sirloin steak option prepared in the best ever Italian recipe that we want to make at home, but it's probably top secret!  Such a memory for our taste buds.  We simply MUST go back!!","Dined on May 14, 2018",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

We also ordered the lasagna and it was one of the best we  have ever had!  The spaghetti and meatballs was average compared to the rest but still good!  The meals were priced really well for the value of the food.  The. ambience is neat and not your average restaurant scene.

"There was no signage outside, so it was somewhat difficult to find. We entered and climbed down the stairs to the less than friendly hostess, where we asked if this was indeed “The Pink Door”. Wow...the look she gave us couldn’t have gotten any more demeaning. And this, from the hostess! Basically set up the evening. The food was great, my cocktail was blah, as was the service. All the waiting staff were doing their job, but very robotic-like and basically gave us the impression that they were there for the job and didn’t really enjoy what they do. Sure, come for the food, but for the price and location, their wait staff should at least pretend they care.","Dined on May 9, 2018",4,5,3,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Had to wait for 20 minutes even after booking the table two weeks before for a 2 PM slot. After we got the table, we were severed one tiny piece of bread (we were wondering if this is to be shared between three people!) they later got two more pieces, then it took a while to get the food we ordered, the food was quiet oily and the waiter just disappeared, other staff avoiding to give eye contact in case anyone asked for anything. Looks like this place is understaffed, the food is greasy and is highly overrated. It was not like this a couple years back but everything has changed now. Would not recommend it to anyone!","Dined on April 27, 2018",1,1,1,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"In April, we were lucky enough to have a sunny day that was warm enough to sit outside at The Pink Door. We go to the restaurant several times a year but mostly in summer and again at Christmas time. Our preference is for a long, leisurely lunch that mimics long leisurely lunches in Italy. The Pink Door always delivers that experience. Our food, from antipasti to dolci was excellent--seasonal, perfectly prepared. There's an excellent wine/liquor list. The view is excellent on a sunny day--ferries, mountains, the bay. And our server was perfect in not hurrying us, totally supporting the leisurely lunch approach (he said he does it as well when he eats at the Pink Door). The only slight downside is when it comes to paying the piper--the bill will be high but not untypical for the Seattle restaurant scene. it's worth it for a special outing. Looking forward to going back again very soon.","Dined on April 20, 2018",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Make sure you make a reservation! The restaurant does not have any outside signage..other than the pink door. Once inside, it's the most adorable, eclectic place we've been to! Next time, we'll have to go for dinner to experience the atmosphere. 
We went during lunch, were seated near the windows, so we had a beautiful view of the waterfront. I ordered the everything green salad, and the lasagna...absolutely one of the most delicious meals I've ever had! The salad was crisp, and so tasty!! For the lasagna, there were 7 delicate spinach pasta layers, that paired perfectly with the most amazing béchamel, pesto and marinara! Don't forget to use your bread to soak up all of the remaining sauce! My husband had the pasta with meatballs, and the sauce was absolutely delicious! You'll need the bread for that sauce too!

We really enjoyed our dinner at the Pink Door. Service was impeccable. The food was better than we experienced in Italy last summer. The meatballs were a perfect blend of ground meats & spices.

"Less than warm welcome. We were late for our reservation, and our table was given away, completely understandable because of the fact. We were made to wait at the bar for another table and then was seated quickly which wasn't too bad. The person who seated us didn't say a word to us in hello and the person who gave us water was far from engaging, even after attempting to start conversation. However, our waitress Lola with the rainbow hair made the rest of the experience amazing. She was engaging and happy and made very awesome suggestions for sights to see in Seattle. Food was spot on and I even found my new favorite wine. Service was fast. Hopefully when I return, which I plan to do to see some shows, the welcome will be a little better.","Dined on March 30, 2018",4,5,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"I made an easy lunch reservation a day before for Pink Door  after finding out that they were reservations only. Dinner reservations may need a few days notice, but I see (and recommend) why this restaurant is reviewed so highly.

Location is right in Pike Place Market, so either plan your day in the area, uber or have a great time looking for parking. Checking-in was easy enough. My group was seated in the ocean view room on one of their beautiful booths.

There wasn't an absured amount of people and the atmosphere was tranquil. -It wasn't loud even though we came from the noisy alleys and Seattle's largest farmer's market.

Though on the pricier end, the food was great. The table had the lasagna, Bolognese, linguine, risotto, large mix appetizers and a half dozen oysters (but came out as 8 pieces to accommodate 4 people!) Everything was very tasty. 

Our server was very helpful! She checked on us the right amount of times to see if we needed anything. Even our water glasses weren't neglected. In the end of our visit, the server let us split the bill among the four. She even offered to help with the calculation even though she didn't have the best mathematic skills.","Dined on March 29, 2018",4,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"This experience was one of the most disappointing experiences I've had at a restaurant. I made a reservation for my daughter's birthday several months in advance based upon the wonderful reviews I read. I made a reservation for 4 people, but it changed to 3 at the last moment. Upon arrival to the Pink Door, I let them know it would be 3 of us instead of 4. After a  longer than expected wait, we were seated at a two person table next to a wall. They had added a third chair to the side of the very small table. It was very uncomfortable with our knees banging against each other all night long. What made it  even more aggravating is that there were two  4 top tables unoccupied right near us. Soon after, the restaurant seated two parties of 3 at those tables. Sitting in such cramped quarters for no good reason really killed the ambience. Then the mediocre food added to the terrible experience. We were in Seattle to celebrate a special occasion and all the other restaurants we went to provided great service and much better food. I think this restaurant may have been good somewhere in the past based upon the reviews, but now they act as if you're lucky to get to eat at their establishment. I think they forget that they remain open because of the patronage of customers. I will never return to this restaurant.","Dined on March 25, 2018",1,2,1,1,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"We were celebrating our 33rd wedding anniversary. It was in the notes and I overheard the hostess say that our server would be made aware. At no time during the meal did our server, Phil, mention that it was a special occasion or say anything about it at all. At the end of the meal, we declined dessert and was presented with the check.  We asked him if he knew it was our anniversary and he said yes. We were in Seattle for 5 days EVERY restaurant at dinner did something, even if it was something small. They ALL acknowledged it. We were very disappointed that The Pink Door is evidently so popular that they don't feel the need to do courteous gestures for their patrons. In 33 years, The Pink Door is the only restaurant (and we have been to many all over the world) to ignore what is usually considered something to celebrate.","Dined on March 25, 2018",4,4,3,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"I came here for my birthday with friends and family. I made a reservation prior and we were able to get seated in the new expanded area which was BEAUTIFUL! The view of the Sound was amazing!

I've been here before with bigger groups in the outdoor area which is also a treat. Overall, I love the Pink Door!

"Thank  you Pink Door! Brought our friend and his wife from out of town. They absolutely LOVED the Pink Door! We made reservations and were seated right away when we got there. We ordered beverages and chatted a while before ordering our apps and meals. The only snafu was that the gentlemen had ordered for their drink to be on ice, when they came to the table they were not. They quickly made a comment and the server brought back the correct drink quickly. 
We ordered the antipasto of the house, had a couple servings of the complimentary bread (so good!), starter salads, pappardelle al ragù Bolognese, cioppino, lamb osso bucco, the ice cream tri, and cookies. Everything was exceptional! We were here to celebrate a birthday and the staff put a candle in the ice cream.

Not to mention, the view was beautiful! We were there just during sunset and probably spent a good three hours here. Our friends could not get enough of it!

"A great spot for a special occasion, or even if you just want quality food at a reasonable price. My girlfriend and I came here to celebrate my birthday and we were not disappointed. There was the pleasant surprise of live music which we didn't know would be going on that night. The staff was very accommodating. I specifically asked for the ""most romantic table available,"" and was sat in the main dining area. (I'd recommend asking for the main dining room vs the entrance room where the bar, stage, and performance area is unless you are there for the music/performance. The noise level in the back dining area was much more conducive to good conversation, and, the view of the Great Wheel is stunning! Thankfully, a party was just getting up from a window seat (ask for a window seat for parties of 2) and we were able to sit there vs. the corner spot where they were going to sit us. I was glad I asked the host to take a picture of us at the beginning of the meal as we had a late reservation, (9:45 PM) and the wheel was still lit up, where after the dinner and dessert, it was not. The food was amazing, and well-priced. (Risotto and Lamb Shank, with brussel sprouts for an app, and the ""Boobie Cake"" for dessert) The waiter was able to suggest wines that paired nicely to each of our meals, and was price conscious which is highly noted and appreciated. (Some servers would automatically go for something priced higher to drive up the total tab) The decor was lovely, bathrooms clean, and the vibe was awesome! We were one of the last two parties to leave and the staff was friendly the whole time, we never got a rushed vibe at all. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","Dined on March 14, 2018",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Pink Door was closed down last year for several months to remodel the restaurant.  The wait was well worth it!  This has always been a popular restaurant but since the renovation it has been tough to get reservations.  Knew I wanted to go here to celebrate anniversary with my husband so I booked a month in advance to get a Saturday night reservation (you can only book up to a month in advance).  I had heard they were just going to remodel the kitchen but was happy to find that besides enlarging the kitchen they also expanded the dining room and bar area!  

We got the one of the best tables in the restaurant.  Table for two and the window overlooking the Pike Place Market and Seattle Wheel.  Simply beautiful view.  If you are not from Seattle this is another great reason to book this restaurant.

As expected this restaurant was packed but service was great.  We had several drinks during dinner and our server was great about brining new drinks once we had finished ours.

Besides a mushroom bruschetta I also had fish of the day which was a Branzino.  It was described as serving for one but could have easily fed two or three.  I was just sorry I could not finish it. Husband had pasta.

I am so looking forward to my next dining experience at Pink Door!

It's bright and cheery and perfect for vendor/client lunches anytime of year. Summer is also great because the outdoor patio is like no other place. Rather than umbrellas to block the sun, they've created a meshed roof so you don't have any direct sun beating on you. But, everyone still wears sunglasses which gives it this California vibe, you'll want to order a drink, and you should, they're good.","Dined on March 1, 2018",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The Pink Door was the perfect spot for dinner on my birthday. We were in town visiting from New Orleans and Houston. We chose The Pink Door because of the delicious looking menu and lightheartedly because my favorite color as a kid was pink.
We started with the lobster ravioli (divine) and brussels sprouts for the table. For entrees we ordered Bolognese, Lamb Oso Bucco, Spaghetti and Meatballs and the Northwest Fish (seared tuna over a bed of flavorful fingerling potatoes and eggplant). Everything was spiced perfectly, had wonderful flavor and was a large portion for the price. For dessert we had ricotta cheesecake and the ice cream trio. Both were delicious. Our reservation was for 9:30pm and the ambiance was perfect at that time. The restaurant wasn't too busy, therefore wasn't too loud. The music was serene, lighting was easy on the eyes and we had a great view of the sound which was an added bonus. Our waiter, David, was kind enough to accommodate dietary restrictions and was very informative about each dish. Thanks David! Next time we are in Seattle we will be back.","Dined on February 20, 2018",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"The restaurant was super cute and bigger then expected from the outside. 
It feels like your in an underground place, but theres a whole back room area where there are large windows that bring in waterfront views. 
We had a lovely sunset , corner table view. 

The food was great. We shared plates since we were not that hungry, but overall experience was lovely.","Dined on February 20, 2018",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"My wife and I were in Seattle for a long weekend vacation and made reservations at The Pink Door, as it came highly recommended from articles online and friends who'd been there before. The restaurant is very eclectic and has a certain charm, that being said we were seated with a great view of the bay. We started out with the artisanal cheese plate, which was excellent. For our entrees, my wife ordered the Pink Door cioppino, which the waiter told us has been on the menu for 36 years. I preserved the bolognese with fresh pasta --- which was amazing. The cioppino, despite being a staple of the restaurant, left something to be desired. The cioppino had very little flavor. While we were both disappointed with the cioppino, the rest of the meal was excellent as was the service.","Dined on February 17, 2018",4,3,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"I typically love coming to the Pink Door but this time around wasn’t very good. When we got sat for our reservation, it took about 15-20 mins before anyone acknowledged us and took our drink order. Our server seemed a bit disoriented and was not engaging whatsoever. We’ve come for birthdays before and our last servers were amazing and fun to chat with. They even offered her a dessert to end the evening but this time, our server and didn’t even mention anything about a birthday even though I put it on our reservation. My friend order the tortellini pasta in broth and it literally looked like a 5 year old put it together. The presentation wasn’t very good compared to everyone else’s. She’s seen photos of that same dish and hers didn’t even come close to what it looked like. In the end, we didn’t get dessert and just decided to leave after we paid. Definitely a disappointing experience. The atmosphere is always great there but this time around the service fell short. I always go when it’s a busy weekend day. I’ll be returning again sometime but I just hope I don’t get the same server","Dined on February 4, 2018",2,3,1,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Our only complaint was that it was pouring rain and blowing like crazy! Our reservation was at 4:00 p.m., when they opened for their dinner seating.  We arrived about 10 minutes early, thinking we could wait in the bar or the lobby.  That was not the case.  The door was locked until exactly 4:00, and we had to wait outside in the cold and rain...not even an awning.  Fortunately, our attitudes changed for the better once they opened the door!

"This was our first time for lunch at The Pink Door - we’d been wanting to go here for quite some time. When we checked in, we were met with a stuffy check-in staff - I’d made a little joke that we almost didn’t find them because the door was more salmon color...wow, not even a fake chuckle, just a glare by 2 of the 3 check in’s..no smiles, no nothing. Then the hostess who seated us made no niceties on the way, but made sure her hair was flipped back numerous times along the way..(gotta look your best, right?)..anyway, something I hate...

We were seated by the window, so thank you for abiding by my window table request. Our server was really nice - she said she was new so that's probably why we were never offered the specials choices, or soup options..that’s OK, it was fun hearing them offered by the server a table over after our meal. I ordered the Cesar salad with crab and the 3 meatballs - all great! A huge Cesar with fresh crab, and the sauce on the meatballs was great! Hubby ordered the kale salad and the chicken sandwich, both of which he dubbed as, “OK”. 

We would return, for sure...nice atmosphere, good seating, not overly noisy, and great view, and the food was good. Don’t expect a warm welcome or anything - more like Vegas when you’re getting seated - hair flipping free of charge!","Dined on January 14, 2018",4,4,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

The views in the back room overlooked the waterfront and you could see the Great Wheel. The food was to die for. It was one of the best meals I’ve had in my life. We got the oysters and the toasted garlic bread as appetizers. The oysters were the best I’ve had, the bread was great. I lost my ID during a bar crawl the night before, so I went for the mock-tail which made losing my ID not so bad. I had the Northwest Fish of the Day, which was absolutely delicious. My boyfriend got the bolognese which he said was very good. For dessert, we had the apple turnover (?) which was the perfect way to end our meal.

"We tried for 3 days to have lunch at the Pink Door!  They were sold out every day!  Finally we lucked out and got four of us in for lunch and we were really happy we did!  What a cool place! Great food great view.  We started with BAGNA CAUDA - which is a “hot bath” of anchovies, garlic & olive oil in which fresh seasonal vegetables are dipped.  Actually - dipping bread in that bubbling oil was even better than the veggies (naughty though!).  My husband had the PHEASANT TORTELLINI IN BRODO, classic housemade pasta in a rich bone broth.  Portion was a little on the small side and he polished it off quickly but it was really good.  My son and I both had RISOTTO with  preserved truffles, wild and domestic mushrooms, farm fresh raw egg yolk, parmigiano-reggiano cheese.  It was excellent. Creamy and rich and so full of flavor.  My other son had PAPPARDELLE AL RAGÙ BOLOGNESE - with slow simmered meat sauce, fresh pasta. He loved it.  We had a great lunch and will definitely go back next trip to Seattle!","Dined on December 28, 2017",4,4,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"This is the first time I’ve been to the Pink Door since they opened the new space that faces west overlooking the market.  The new space is bright with a great view of the market which complements the darker room at the front of the restaurant.  The food was very good as usual.  I had the kale salad which was carefully prepared with finely chopped kale, raisins, and nuts, with a side of chicken.  My friend had a Caesar salad with shrimp that he complimented.  The service was friendly and attentive.  A great location that’s added to its appeal by adding additional space.","Dined on December 28, 2017",4,4,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

We love the Pink Door and I've been a regular for over 18 years after moving to Seattle to attend University of Washington. This was our families first time back since having children & we were excited to share our love of this restaurant with our 4 & 5 year old. We couldn't think of a better restaurant to celebrate the holiday season in downtown Seattle. The new dining room along with the amazing staff & of course food exceeded all of our expectations. What an amazing night that we look forward to making a tradition every holiday.,"Dined on December 24, 2017",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Though I've been to Pink Door at least 70 or 80 times, this was my first visit after the renovation done in early 2017. Yes, it's changed but is still wonderful. Friends and I have an annual long-lunch at Pink Door over the holidays, and this meal matched those of the past. Great drinks, great food, great service. The main change (as I could see from one visit at least) is that there are four different ways to enjoy the Pink Door: fancy-ish (in the large dining room with the gorgeous view), casual (in the old dining room, still cosy & funky), in the bar (larger and with some views of food-prep), and on the deck (too cold in winter but looks the same as in the past). I think the renovation only adds good things to the Pink Door--and I'm quite relieved for it...though I do miss having to get The Code for the, ahem, facilities. That fun in-the-know experience is replaced with clean & large toilets, easily accessible in-house. That's okay too. I'm really looking forward to our next visit there.","Dined on December 24, 2017",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

The ambiance and service was excellent.

Even had a live band trio playing in the background.

I had a local porter on tap.

We ordered the smoked tuna appetizer salad.

For dinner we ordered the lamb shank and the linguine with clams.

The food was good, but nothing screamed I have to run back here and eat next week.

The highlight of my meal was the owners house blended special olive oil served with a fresh local bakery bread.

It had amazing flavors!

The food wasn't bad, it just didn't ""wow""  me for all the hype we had heard.

The food is outstanding. Try the cheese plate. The prosciutto and mozzarella starter is also scrumptious. Service was excellent. Ask for Elyse. Great with suggestions, watched over us without being obtrusive, checked back on us several times and was efficient too. I recommend making reservations. While it's worth the wait - truly it is - why wait when you don't have to. And, definitely dine here during the summer months.

"Quite disappointed that we didn't see the burlesque show during our lunch, we booked our reservation for our birthday lunch so we were pretty excited to get a show with it. After the fact we saw (after literally having to search for it) that it's only at dinner time Friday & Saturday nights which is understanding but I don't think a burlesque show should be part of the restaurants primary description if it's not happening all the time. Our server was kind, seemed a little rushed even though it wasn't really that busy - he could have had a bigger section and we weren't aware. That's fine. My friend and I have worked in the industry so we don't get upset by it. I was also thrown off at how fast the spaghetti & meatballs came out...suspiciously fast which of course made me pay too much attention at how hot it was and the sauce seemed almost separated from itself..microwaved? I hope not for that much money. The garlic bread was AMAZING though!!! A good peppery background spice with all those yummy oils. I would suggest somebody go if you're scheduling during the burlesque show so you get your monies worth in entertainment.","Dined on November 19, 2017",3,3,3,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

My husband and I got lunch here around 2pm. We chose the patio as it was a sunny day. All the sun was landing right into my eye as some patio tables face directly to pike place.

We started with the oysters which were fresh and flavorful. I had the cioppino and was not disappointed. It was ridiculously delicious.  The best I've ever eaten. My daughter had the muscles and clams in white wine sauce. She was in heaven. Although full, we knew we had to taste the dessert.  I ordered the ricotta cheese cake on the waiter's recommendation, and my daughter ordered the trio of ice creams. Again, just perfection. We are adding The Pink Door to our list of absolute favorites.","Dined on October 29, 2017",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Love the water view from the back room of the restaurant, but then you miss the aerial artist in the front room! Have been on multiple occasions and food has been consistently good. Is romantic and lends itself to quiet conversation if not a live music night. Get reservations early - hard to get sometimes.","Dined on October 28, 2017",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"I was visiting Seattle and had multiple people recommend The Pink Door as a fantastic eatery, and they were right!  The environment was cool--eclectic but not kitschy and just fun decor.  The service was fantastic--knowledgeable, made great suggestions, prompt but never over eager.  The food was perfect--the cheese platter was sublime!

"Traveled from Texas all day. Lively atmosphere; great service from the moment we were welcomed. Hard to find at first. It’s literally just a pink door in an alley. Had reservations later in the evening but we ended up going earlier. They were very accommodating to the change in our schedule.  Looks like they have live entertainment each night which I wish we got to see. Food was good, but not a huge menu. Large wine list, though we enjoyed a seasonal brown ale. Over all we enjoyed our first meal in Seattle.","Dined on October 19, 2017",5,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

I loved the ambience of this place. It’s one of the best restaraunt I have been to. Our server was very polite and prompt. The Tuscan fries and lasagna was great. As well as for dessert we ordered a cabaret cake which tasted awesome. Only downside was the garlic bread which didn’t seem fresh and was hard to chew. The place has been designed quite creatively and fact that you have to enter through an almost easy to miss pink door adds to excitement for the place. I just wish the garlic bread was better and I could have given it 5 stars on food as well. Would definitely eat here next time I am in Seattle,"Dined on October 16, 2017",4,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Problem: My first experience was amazing. My second fell short. There. End of review. 

The first time I came here was January 2016. Since then I've been wanting to come back. Pink Door had perfectly cooked prawns (unlike most restaurants in CA that overlooked theirs). Service and ambiance were amazing. We used to make jokes and say things like ""I would sacrifice eating my mom's food. IF I COULD HAVE PINK DOOR."" That's how much we liked it.

For my friend's birthday (and first time to Seattle), we took her there. No hesitation. There was no wait. The host said ""Happy birthday!"" However, we were in and out within 45 minutes, which is unfortunate because the live music was beautiful. Their ambiance is perfect.

The prawns were a bit overlooked this time. Sad. Service was okay. Have you ever experienced good service, but felt like it was lacking because it didn't seem genuine? That is the best way I can describe the experience. The gentlemen refilling our water did their job. I always had water. The gentleman taking care of us was courteous and polite. But he didn't go above and beyond. 

When making the reservation, I requested a complimentary treat - if available. We ended up not getting anything. I wish they would've reached out to say ""Hey, we don't provide any complimentary desserts. However, you can purchase a slice of cake for $10."" Something like that. But that didn't happen. That night I saw a couple tables with deserts and a candle, and felt bad that my friend didn't get one. A big bummer.","Dined on October 5, 2017",3,3,3,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

We had really looked forward to returning to the Pink Door as we had not been there in a while and had always had a positive experience.  We explained to our waiter that we wanted an unhurried evening.  We even asked that we would delay ordering our entre to be sure of a leisurely pace.  He assured us that it would not be a problem so we ordered all at once.  We had not finished our salad and appetizers when he began whisking away our plates.  When we objected he took back the entrees and said he would have the kitchen make new dishes when we were ready. To say the least we were disturbed and disappointed.  The food was delicious but our enjoyment had been marred by the poor timing.,"Dined on October 5, 2017",4,4,3,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The Pink Door never disappoints.  On top of the best lasagna in the world their daily fish specials,  scrumptious salads and pasta dishes are always wonderful, beautifully served and incredibly tasty.  It doesn't get any better than sitting on their deck on a beautiful day in Seattle.  The beautiful new addition with a light filled room and not having to get a code and walk down the hall to the bathroom just make the Pink Door even better.  One of my absolute favorite places in Seattle.  I love taking out of town friends there.  Good job Jackie Roberts!

"Newly-remodeled and even better. Bar area more open and inclusive. The added dining area is spacious and comfortable, however late afternoon sun was brutal until they closed the blinds. Not a big deal. 

Service was its usual good quality. Food, as always, great and interesting. Had the pasta with clams and mussels. Awesome. 

Was worried the remodel would cause the restaurant to lose its personality, but not the case. In fact, enhanced it. The Pink Door remains one of my favorite Seattle landmarks. Well done.","Dined on October 2, 2017",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"When we were in Seattle previously, we went to The Pink Door and loved it. A very different atmosphere and wonderful Italian  food. So when we returned to Seattle, we went back to this restaurant--twice! The Lasagne is one of the best we've ever eaten, and the spaghetti (my favorite pasta), which we had as a half portion appetizer, was cooked a perfect al dente with an amazing sauce. We went back a second time so my husband could get the Halibut, which he had to pass up for the Lasagne on our first visit. He was not disappointed and loved it!  And I had the spaghetti (and meatballs) again since it was so good. I recommend this wonderful restaurant highly! The staff is top quality, the ambiance is amazing, and the food is so good!  The recent renovations to the restaurant have opened up the back room and made it cozy with beautiful huge windows overlooking part of Pike's Market and the waterfront. Be sure to make a reservation!","Dined on September 20, 2017",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"With all the diverse dining and cuisine options Seattle offers, Pink Door has always been a favorite. Though I have not been back since before the renovation, it was the same wonderful menu and atmosphere. It was great to see it more opened up and more seating options. However, once a semi-dark, romantic, even maybe tastefully macabre, has turned into a casual, quick bite meal, surrounded by kids. While our food was excellent as always, service was rushed and felt like a really quick turn around. We were only there for a little over an hour from being sat to signing the check. Normally, no big deal, but we were here for a special occasion that ended up just feeling extremely rushed. Not to beat a dead horse, but upon making the reservation, OpenTable asked us if there was a special occasion, which I noted was a 1 year wedding anniversary, went unacknowledged. Overall, not a huge deal, just a bit disappointed that I talked it up so much.","Dined on September 18, 2017",3,5,3,2,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"We usually avoid touristy areas like Pike Place Market but we make an exception for The Pink Door. Stopped first at the bar for two very refreshing, sour cocktails. A French 75 and Lemoncello. Both were cold and refreshing after our long day of touring the piers. 

Started with an amazing bruchetta appetizer that featured fresh tomatoes and basil on a crunchy french bread. The ingredients were all super fresh, locally grown and perfectly matched. Be sure to get this if you go there in the next few weeks (September). Tomatoes just can't stay this perfect for very long.

I had the special, White Salmon. It was absolutely amazing. The light, salmon can be bland but it was married with a subtle cauliflower sauce that brought out the flavors in a creative dish that was perfectly accented with spring peas. We have eaten here many times but this was the best dish yet (of course I say that every time).

My wife enjoyed the black ink pasta. It was full of fresh calamari, musles and shrimp all perfectly brought together with handmade black linguine in a fresh tomato sauce. She loved every bite but I still think mine was better. 

The service their is always good but our waitress was especially friendly and helpful with a beautiful smile. My suggestion is not to hold the touristy neighborhood against this restaurant, everything else about it is great.","Dined on September 10, 2017",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Their only gluten-free pasta is penne, so no lasagna, unfortunately. That said, the gluten-free penne was outstanding. Al dente, perfect texture, and very tasty.

"I'm struggling with this review because I believe on a different night The Pink Door could be so much better then our rating.  

We were seated on their patio which wasn't the most scenic section of the restaurant.  Our table was on a busy corner traffic area and the people and waiters passing by kept hitting my chair.  Very annoying.  The patio was also extremely noisy.  

Service was very good.  Food was solid.  We chose the Lasagna and Salmon paired with a Nebbiolo wine.  

Now for the struggle with the review...we're thinking if we were inside and dined on a night with entertainment everything would have been much better.  Probably will never know, but we would suggest patrons choose the inside of the restaurant and go on a night/time where they have music or their trapeze act.","Dined on August 30, 2017",3,4,4,2,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

I say ""hidden"" because it's hard to find the entrance, if you haven't been here before.  It is not clearly marked.  Literally, look for ""The Pink Door"".  I had pasta with meatballs and it was delicious.  I'm Italian, so I'm picky about my pasta dishes and this was excellent. The meatballs were rich with Italian spices, but not mushy.

I got the impression they were trying to hustle us out. To me, it seemed a bit touristy and overpriced. My meal was good.","Dined on August 20, 2017",3,4,3,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

So happy to have found the Pink Door! Food was so good & the atmosphere was great! We went on a Wednesday night and had a 9PM reservation. We sat on the patio and it was super romantic. It was really busy even on a Wednesday at 9. There was a jazz band playing which made it even more romantic. We can't wait to go back!,"Dined on August 17, 2017",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"After seeing all the high ratings we were excited to try this spot. It had a great vibe when we walked in and a nice view from patio dining. However the appetizer, bruschetta, was underwhelming. It was charred to the point of tasting burned and while the tomatoes were fresh and delicious there wasn't much flavor otherwise. When the main courses of lasagna and risotto came out, the lasagna was very good.  However the risotto was about half corn half risotto which made for an odd risotto  texture and we ended up splitting the lasagna and leaving most of the risotto. Our waiter didn't seem to notice or ask so we just settled on the tab and went looking elsewhere for a more satisfying dessert. Overall disappointing.","Dined on August 17, 2017",2,2,3,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"I'm so glad that I found this place on Open Table!  We went for lunch after touring Pike's Place Market and found it down a little side alley.  The food was wonderful and we could sit outside on the patio and enjoy a sunny, cool day.  Our friend who joined us, lives in Seattle and couldn't believe that we'd found this gem.  She said that she loves the place and was thrilled that we'd made reservations there.  I'd go back to The Pink Door right now if I could!!","Dined on August 14, 2017",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"We had friends from out of town and wanted a special experience.
The food selection was excellent and everything we ordered was amazing.
This is a restaurant my husband and I have had on our list of ""favorite restaurants"", for many years.  It is hard to get last minute reservations which is a little frustrating, it seems like you have to book at least two weeks in advance which makes it hard for busy people like ourselves.","Dined on August 13, 2017",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"We planned our dinner at The Pink Door weeks in advance to celebrate a special day. The hostess was completely out of her element and should not be in the service industry. When we requested a table inside, as there was a dog next to the table they were seating us at on the patio, the guy who was seating us said he would have to go see if the have an inside table for us. He never came back but in his place was the unprofessional, discourteous, rude hostess. She started off the conversation stating that all open table reservations are for the patio only and she stated it says that on open table and on the confirmation email. After taking the time to enlighten her on the facts, nowhere on open table not on the email does it state the reservation is a patio only reservation, she finally sat us inside. By this time we had lost our appetites and decided to dine somewhere else. 

Word of advice: it is not we, the customer, who should be grateful that you allow us to pay for the food and ""service"" provided, but rather the restaurant and staff should be grateful for their customers and treat them with respect and as the customer. 

Lost a significant customer who's family has been dinning at The Pink Door for over 25 years. 

Hire professional customer service focused staff and the restaurant would be in a much better place.","Dined on August 7, 2017",1,1,1,2,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Took my husband to The Pink Door for his birthday. I had heard about the restaurant, but we had never been there before. We were happy to see the Italian focus to the menu. He comes from a big, east coast Italian family, so we love that food.  The restaurant was so clean and pretty. The vibe was cool and friendly, and it seemed like every staff member was happy to be there. Our waitress (Catrina) just made the dinner better. She had the right mix of helpful but not bossy, happy but not cloying. Great service. We started with the antipasto platter;  I had lasagna, and my husband had risotto.  All food was great, though my husband says he is getting the lasagna next time. He loved sampling mine so much! Split the peach crostata for dessert, and again, great taste during the summer.

I love the food, service is great, the inside is cozy in winter, the deck is fantastic in the summer.  I am looking forward to a safe, responsible, re-opening.


When we go to other countries, like France and England, we embarrass ourselves by how loud Americans talk.  And, I don’t need loud music to enjoy an evening in a restaurant.  Loud music impedes communication and diminishes enjoyment.  The only thing loud music achieves is getting people to leave earlier than they might want - and this results in tables turning more quickly. Please reduce decibels.  

And once we have hot summer nights, the open windows in the expanded area offer a beautiful view, and a welcome breeze.","Dined on July 13, 2017",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"First off, be aware that this is a very popular destination. I made my reservation on line more than a week in advance, and had limited openings available. We were seated outside, which *technically* has a view of the Bay, but you are looking across the roofs of several intervening buildings. The location is hard to reach: the landscape is extremely steep, parking is limited, the entrance is basically unmarked (and at the time of our visit, more of a peach color than ""pink"") and along a narrow, crowded alley. Once inside, even room to wait is hard to come by, but the feel is energetic, the decor eclectic, and we saw a group of musicians setting up for a live performance.

Most of that was, unfortunately, wasted on us as we were on the covered patio, and at a tiny table in a narrow alcove, at the very fringes of the seating area.  Nonetheless, the menu was intriguing, and our server went above and beyond the call in explaining the selections to us. He even managed to be good-natured when we pointed out a few minor grammatical errors and other quirks (my daughter is an English professor and I am, well, an anal-retentive nerd). One entree was prepared with ""the finest of olive oils"", for instance, while another was described as having ""really, really good olive oil"". We asked what the difference was, and our server rose to the challenge and had an answer at the ready.

The food was very good, the server attentive and agile enough to repeatedly squeeze past the table near ours and take good care of us. All in all, it was a fine dinner and a good introduction to Seattle (my daughter had recently moved there and I was visiting - we are both from the East Coast - to help her get settled and explore her new home).","Dined on July 7, 2017",3,4,4,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"The Pink Door was recommended to me as a must-stop in Seattle. It is indeed an iconic place to eat (though make sure reservations are far in advance.) The atmosphere is unique, the service wonderful, and the food was amazing! One of the best meals I have had in a restaurant. We started with the cheese board and a bottle of Prosecco. For my main I had the eggplant rigatoni (recommended by the waiter) and it was one of the best pasta meals I have had, with smoky mozzarella and  seasoned eggplant cooked perfectly. We finished with a couple of desserts and after dinner drinks - a must experience while in Seattle!","Dined on July 7, 2017",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Visiting from Chicago, made a reservation and we were seated immediately upon arrival in their beautiful patio.

"I've been to Pink Door twice now, and the service is iffy - the service we had the first time was absolutely fantastic, whereas the server we had this time was a bit cold and seemed annoyed the entire time. He asked if we wanted bread after our meal had already come out, and when I asked for more honey for my cheese plate, he looked as if I was asking for his arm. Food was okay - it wasn't phenomenal, but also not bad. I'd come back if only for the drinks and ambiance.","Dined on July 4, 2017",3,3,2,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"The Pink Door was great!  We had a late night reservation at 9:45pm but they didn't rush us.  We sat outside as we were there during the summertime and it was really nice out; the view is spectacular.       

I had the parpadelle and it was phenomenal.  The pasta was definitely freshly made and the simple red sauce that accompanied it was delish.  My husband had the cioppino and he said it was good.  I am convinced he would've liked more in terms of portions, but he won't admit it.  He said the flavors were there but the broth was a little on the thinner side than he is used to; no docking of points for this as the sauce consistency is just a matter of preference.  For dessert we shared the chocolate ooey gooey and it was fantastic.  

Definitely recommended if it's your first time in Seattle.   The drinks and food are good, the ambiance is definitely upbeat and the service awesome.","Dined on July 3, 2017",4,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"This place lived up the many positive reviews we've read.  It's easy to see why this place was buzzing on a Thursday night.  The staff is outstanding.  Everybody from the hostess, to the bartender and the waiter were all friendly, accommodating and professional.  My wife noted it was my birthday dinner and asked for a ""window seat"" when she made the reservation - we got a nice table along the window.   We were early and they seated us as soon as the table was available.  The other couple with us was 40 minutes late -  the staff seemed unfazed and kept us well oiled with drinks while we waited.  The Halibut special was nicely prepared, with an excellent sauce that set it off well.  All the other food was well-prepared and tasty.  

In short,  it was a very positive experience and we will be returning.","Dined on June 23, 2017",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"I normally don't write reviews because I am too busy, but I met up with a friend who is in from out of town and I wanted some place very ""Seattle"" for her and she wanted somewhere with a patio.   I had been there previously a few years ago and had thought it was just ""OK"" but this time the food was really stellar and I understood why it's a bit of an institution. I work in fine dining and even from that point of view, I was really impressed with everything.  Our server was great, I don't remember his name but he seemed like he was Italian (he had an accent),  his suggestions both for wine and food were spot on and we had a fabulous time.","Dined on June 7, 2017",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"It's been awhile since we were at The Pink Door and, boy, were we glad to rediscover it! I originally made the reservation for the view, to introduce east coast friends to Seattle. My husband grumbled because he remembered the food as ""meh"" and the wine selections as mediocre. NOT ANYMORE! 

This was a fabulous lunch. Every bite was mouth-watering and the wine list was superb and reasonably priced. We had a mixed antipasti platter, the fresh salmon special, seared scallops and the Dungeness Crab Risotto, plus rich chocolate-covered cream puffs for dessert. Absolutely delightful. Staff was very friendly, maybe not super efficient, but my forgotten coffee was comped when they remembered to bring it. 

Our only head-scratcher was the clunky water glasses they used to serve the wine. Cool wines that they have on the list deserve better than the awkward Flintstone glasses they're using. Overall, though, we can't wait to go back!","Dined on June 7, 2017",5,5,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"We arrived on time  for lunch and at first they couldn't find our reservation, then the hostess abruptly left and eventually came back and said our table wasn't ready so we sat down to wait. After 15 minutes, and seeing several empty tables for four, we all went back to the front and hung around until they finally seated us (20 minutes past our reservation time). No apologies, no, ""Thanks for your patience.""
Our waiter was friendly and the food was okay; not bad just nothing special. While we were sitting at our table they moved the tables behind us around and shoved a corner of the table into my son's back but didn't aknowledge it. When we left my son asked to see the manager and talked to her about the issues and she offered to comp our meal or give us a gift certificate but he had already paid and we don't live in the area so he let it go. She did apologize.
My son just got his credit card bill today and he was overcharged by about $125, so the saga continues.
Even if the staff had been friendlier or more accommodating, I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. The decor is cute and the food was good enough but not great, so definitely not worth the time and effort it took to get reservations.","Dined on May 14, 2017",1,3,1,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

In saying that, both dishes were still delicious, just unfortunately not what we expected.  I do recommend people go for the experience though.","Dined on May 13, 2017",4,4,4,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The Pink Door picked up right where they left off   They successfully preserved the ambience of the original place in the front room, while providing an open and air experience in the new dining room.

"Birthday - service was great. The check in and check out area is too small.  We arrive about 10m before I reservation and we had to wait on our table.  There is no place to wait except outside in the cold. Once we were done the hostess had no idea which coats were ours. They have no checking system, they just take your coats. When the performer started the entry between the two rooms became wall to wall people so we weren't able to see the show.  Everything else was wonderful, the service and food is exceptional.","Dined on December 31, 2016",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"A friend of ours recommended this restaurant. My positive experience with the Pink Door is that I was seated at the proper time, the staff was very courteous. My negative experience started with my waiter with a nose ring.  It seems out of place with the appearance of the establishment. The food we ordered consisted of the rib plate, which was mostly fat.  The salad which was covered in oil that I couldn't eat it.  The only thing on the plate that was eatable was the potatoes and you charged $38.00 for this.  The lasagna portions were too small for the price, and the flavor was nothing special. In my opinion, you can have a better meal at Olive Garden.","Dined on December 30, 2016",2,1,3,2,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

This is the first time that I ever visited when I wouldn't give it the full number of stars on everything.

"We felt there was too much hype...we made reservations and got a confirmation, then another email follow-up, THEN another phone follow-up an hour before our reservation.  But it was never full at 4:00 p.m., nor when we left at 6:00 p.m..  Yes, the place is unique for the ""swing"" entertainment, but those windows of entertainment are very limited.  My husband's chair faced an unadorned cement wall, so I think some thought about re-arranging seating would be nice.  About one-third of the seats had the same problem.  Maybe a large mirrored wall ?!  That would certainly create a better view for everyone, not just those facing into the center of the restaurant.  Having said this, it is a nice restaurant.  Not truly worthy of the hype, but pleasant enough and with an occasional quirk.  Don't think we will return.","Dined on December 12, 2016",4,4,4,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The best part of the Pink Door was its hidden pink door in an alley and the salads.  The wait staff was excellent, but the entrees were very small and the ravioli tasted like you were sucking on a lemon.  It was very loud, conversation was difficult to have.  The restrooms are difficult to get to, they require you leave the back of the restaurant and walk a gauntlet of Seattle's finest homeless and heroin addicts.  It advertises live entertainment, but fails to mention that the entertainment does not start until later in the evening.  I will not return.","Dined on November 19, 2016",4,3,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

The garlic bread was a little on the crunchy side but it was fine. Nothing spectacular to write about. Our server was very sweet and nice.

"Wonderful food & drink, fun to finally experience this historic restaurant. We dined early, I would love to go when there is entertainment. The ONLY complaint would be I feel we were a little rushed and over attended by the wait staff, but perhaps this is because of my recent dining experiences in France, where there is absolutely no pressure to finish up and clear the table.","Dined on October 26, 2016",5,5,4,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Found this while planning a visit in the Seattle area. Once there, several people recommended the Pink Door to us. The food was excellent and the trapeze show (Mondays and Sundays only I beleive) was good and helped make this a memorable dining experience. Part of the experience is just finding the place as there is no signage to point it out, only a nondescript industrial looking door with no markings.","Dined on October 25, 2016",5,5,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
Loved the pappardelle. Took both kids with me and they were able to order 1/2 portions of the pasta on the menu which was nice.

"I met a friend for a restaurant week lunch at the Pink Door.  I was early and my friend was late but the staff were most accommodating. I decided on the restaurant week 3 course with wine pairing.  Since I had some time to kill while waiting for my friend I asked if I could have the first of the wine pairings to sip on while I waited.  No problem.  The waiter was attentive but not overbearing.
I got  a first course of crostini with tapenade. Very good.  Second was cioppino. Excellent.  Then for dessert an apple cake. The wine paired with the cake was perfect.

"My first time here was in the late 80s. Eventually, I moved to the area and went there on many occasions, including my daughters (twins) 18 & 21 year birthday celebrations. Over the years this became a destination for our family. Nine years ago I moved to the Bay Area and when I  get the chance to go to Seattle, the Pink Door is on the top of the list. No matter what! 
It is whimsical, fun and truly a must NOT 'pass' kind of place.
For me, it's the food, the service and the atmosphere. I feel like I am transported to another place in time... In a good way. I could just move in and be content.
I had the halibut, my son had his favorite lasagna... And we shared a very nice chocolate cake with incredible ice cream. Timing is everything... We did not get to see the trapeze act or the Cabaret... Perhaps next time...","Dined on October 2, 2016",5,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The Pink Door is one of our favorites when we're down at the Market, and we take special friends and family there, knowing it will be a good experience. I wanted to give them 5 stars again this time, but our experience wasn't up to its usual excellence. We normally dine indoors and love the ambience, but this time we were on the patio and found it much less satisfying--noisy, uncomfortable, and crowded. We also had a miserable greeting from the young female hostess (I don't know her name) who was bordering on rude and unwelcoming. I had tried to change our reservation online to 5 people from 4 when my daughter unexpectedly was able to join us. I wasn't able to make the change and explained it to the hostess, who had us standing around waiting unnecessarily for someone to add two chairs (I told her we only needed one extra) and treated us as if we were imposing on her. The restaurant had just opened for lunch and we were the first to arrive, so it should have been easy to just scoot one chair over to the table and get us seated so we wouldn't be blocking the doorway. It was a disagreeable start to what was supposed to be a special luncheon for our family. That said, our server was great and the food was as good as we've come to expect. We'll be back.","Dined on September 5, 2016",4,4,4,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"I love going to the Pink Door because of it's romantic feel and ambiance. I was slightly disappointed in the service and the food on this visit. Our waitress was very nice but the service did seem a bit slow. Our food took longer than normal so our waitress brought us salads, which was very nice. The lasagne was absolutely amazing but I was disappointed in the chicken entree. There was not a lot of flavor and it was not as moist it should have been. I do recommend this restaurant though as most dishes are wonderful.","Dined on September 4, 2016",3,3,3,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"My husband and I really enjoyed our dinner date at Pink Door. We sat on the patio, which was nice - but would have been even nicer if the weather had cooperated in being a bit warmer. Our server was very professional and attentive to our needs. He helped us to pick out cocktails and then a bottle of wine. We almost ordered the full antipasto platter, but he warned us not to if we were considering entrees as well. Thank goodness for that advice! The half-size antipasto plate was still a lot of food and so delicious!! I would recommend that appetizer to anyone going to Pink Door - it was my favorite thing of the night.  I was already almost full from the appetizer, so I ended up ordering an entree sized Caesar salad with grilled prawns. It was a good caesar but not my favorite - I'm kind of a fan right now of caesar salad where they actually grill the romaine itself - regardless , there was nothing wrong with it. My husband ordered the pasta special of the night with some sort of a tomato sauce made with pancetta and pork belly - the flavor was out of this world and the pasta was fresh and a perfect al dente. Finished off with a Spanish coffee, which was delicuious and strong","Dined on August 28, 2016",5,4,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

The beat and arugula salad was delicious and our server was friendly and attentive. They serve beautiful and interesting cocktails, one that passed by was sparkling pink with flower petals on top and looked refreshing.  We both had the salad but the dishes on other tables all looked appetizing as well.  They bring fresh sourdough bread and olive oil for dipping to the table automatically, so if you don't care for the extra carbs, let your sever know.

"Pink Door just fell short of expectations based on reviews.   Promptly seated on the patio upon arrival at 8pm.  Interior dining rooms and patio were all pretty full.  Could see the jazz band from where we sat, but the soundproof windows are just that as you couldn't hear a thing. 

Service was pretty attentive up until dessert was dropped.  Then - our server was MIA for at LEAST half an hour -- took FOREVER to get our check - probably spent close to an hour waiting for the check and handling payment.

Food was good to mediocre.  We did the 1/2 order of House Antipasti, Lasagna Pink Door, Spinach Contorni & Upside Down berry cake.   The Antipasti was plentiful even for a 1/2 order and tasty - nothing special.  Lasagna Pink Door was OK - a little overcooked (too soft & slimy).  Spinach Contorni was tasteless  & bland - would never order this again - my cat could cook better spinach.  Upside Down berry cake was good -- on the lighter side which we wanted vs. Chocolate Gooey cake.  

Definitely can see how this would be an appealing place to take out-of-towners - patrons ran the gamut of cocktail dress to tourist garb.  The view was not that spectacular -but, enjoyable enough during sunset.  

Overall - kitschy and acceptable.  Would not go out of my way to come back again though based solely on the food.  Also - the ""pink"" door  on the Post side seems a bit dingy - with too much yellow making it more of a faded ""creamy mauve""  door.","Dined on July 29, 2016",3,3,3,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"My boyfriend and I are visiting Seattle and wanted a romantic dinner type of night and found The Pink Door. 

The decor and the ambiance of the restaurant was just perfect. To top it off, our server Amanda was excellent! I went with their special spicy seafood ""squid ink"" pasta and my boyfriend had the Pappardelle al Ragu Bolognese, both were popular dishes and sure enough.. they did not disappoint!! Both dishes tasted amazing and I specially loved the special ""squid ink"" pasta. Of course, we had to end our dinner with dessert and we tried their Chocolate ooey-gooey which also tasted great!

Overall, we had a great experience with this restaurant!!","Dined on July 22, 2016",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Great as always!! I was with my teenage son - all the families with kids were on the upper part of the deck - kind of corralled!  It was still very enjoyable.  Our server, Andrew, was the perfect blend of attentive and unobtrusive.  Food: superb although the mussels weren't well cleaned.  Everything else- very delicious.","Dined on July 17, 2016",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Went on recommendations from friends.   Food was not up to the hype. Noodles and risotto over cooked,  mussels and clams full of sand, garlic bread lacked garlic,  sauce for fish of the day bland.    Go with caution as our review on trip advisor was bumped way down in just a day by a bunch of reviews that subtly contradicted our review.  Coincidence maybe but suspicious to have so many reviews in just one day and all positive on the very concerns I had.","Dined on July 16, 2016",2,1,2,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"Great view for lunch.  We sat outside on their upper deck and the view was terrific.

"I took my sister, who was visiting from Germany, to the pink door for lunch. We sat on the patio. Both of us enjoyed the overall experience, and I would recommend it for having lunch on a summer-day to enjoy  the view over the roof tops of the houses in that vicinity and puget sound.  The food was good, but not great. I had pasta with mushrooms which were too salty for my taste. And I had the feeling that everything was prepared ahead of time; the mains arrived at our table in less than 10 minutes time.","Dined on July 14, 2016",4,4,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Because my friend visiting from SFO had treated me to many great dining experiences there, I wanted to do the same for her. I looked at dozens of restaurants online, my criteria being an intimate setting, good food, not too expensive, and some kind of view. I stumbled upon the Pink Door and it happened to be everything I'd hoped for. Casually chic, small, unique, with a laid-back but efficient server, good food, and a wonderful view and atmosphere. Can't wait to go back.","Dined on July 14, 2016",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Our first visit to Seattle, we decided to try this restaurant with outside seating . The first item we ordered was carpaccio.  While it was tasty, as we began to eat it, we noticed that the garnishment had a hair in it.  We quietly showed the waitress and she agreed and took it away without charging us for it.  She then asked how we had found out about the restaurant, we told her Open Table.  The next thing we knew, our reservation had been cancelled by the restaurant.  Open Table reinstated the reservation.

It seemed to be a nice restaurant, but we will not return there.","Dined on July 8, 2016",1,1,2,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Only minor complaint was when they called to confirm and asked if we wanted inside/outside we went with inside to watch the trapezist.  We ended up outside-  which was gorgeous so no complaints-  but just mildly frustrating.","Dined on July 4, 2016",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

The service is wonderful in the evening, but I have to say when I was there for lunch recently it seemed like they have their B-squad out.

Also, the service was somewhat mixed. We were congratulated for our anniversary so I appreciated that. However, when we showed up for our reservation, we were told to come back in 10 minutes. When we came back, the table was not ready and we had to wait an additional 20 minutes. All in all, I think The Pink Door is a unique and decent dining establishment. However, I  do not intend on coming back since there are better options in terms of food and service.","Dined on June 19, 2016",3,3,2,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Great spot for a date night! Was charming and intimate was perfect. However the only disappointing part was no acrobats. I was excited to surprise my husband, but soon found out it's only for Sundays and Mondays which I thought was odd days to have acrobats when everyone is going out on Friday and Saturday. Other then that food was delicious and service was great! Would recommend acrobats on Friday and Saturday nights!

I had emailed from England weeks before our trip to ask for a table with a view over the waterfront and mentioned it was my birthday . As soon as we were seated at the exact table I'd requested the lovely lady who served us wished me 'Happy Birthday' and when it came to dessert there were candles to blow out! 
It was a Friday night and the restaurant was buzzing with locals and tourists and a Band of Musicians was playing which added to the great feel of the place.

the cocktails were smooth and punchy (vodka for her, gin for me), the dozen oysters were perfect.  for main course, I got the largest fish I had ever eaten an Alaskan Rockfish that was both succulent and easy to get off the bone.
for dessert the butterscotch she got smooth and sweet, and my chocolate dessert was decadent, both washed down by complementary prosecio.  service was friendly and attentive when we needed it with regular water refills on a warm .  there was enough noise that you knew the place was buzzing, yet quiet enough to easily converse.  made for a beautiful special occasion experience

"We visited the Pink Door on a Saturday evening, it was one of those warm Spring days when you really enjoyed the weather. We sat outside on the porch with a wonderful view of the harbor. The  food was really hit-and-miss. We love authentic Italian food so we ordered the antipasto place (amazing) and caesar salad (outstanding), and the pea-crusted bruscetta (zero flavor). My wife ordered the salmon tagliatelli because she loves salmon: the salmon was cut into very small pieces that were completely absorbed by the cream sauce (I love the taste of salmon but I want big enough pieces that I can actually taste it), I would give it a B- at best. I ordered the lamb osso buco and was very disappointed--extremely salty, the broth tasted like pure soy sauce and I had no interest in sopping up the juices. I would not order it again. Maybe if I ordered  the fresh pasta I would have had a better experience.  Positives: ambiance and service. Negatives: be careful what you order, read reviews beforehand.","Dined on May 1, 2016",4,3,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"A coworker recommended a stop at The Pink Door during out stay in Seattle. We happened to make reservations for the last night of restaurant week, so we ordered off the special menu. The food was delicious, but for the price, portions were so small we ended up going somewhere afterwards since we were still hungry. The butterscotch boudin was delicious, but 4 stalks of asparagus for 1st course and a small piece of swordfish and 3 chunks of potato for 2nd course was not what I expected for $30/per plate.","Dined on April 22, 2016",4,4,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The Pink Door is known for its lasagna and that is what my boyfriend and I decided to try for Restaurant Week. The lasagna was great, however the rest of the dinner was just a little disappointing. I realize that portions are small during restaurant week, however the appetizer was just a little laughable. The Caesar salad came out as three uncut romaine lettuce leaves. It was a fine salad, there was enough dressing on it and some croutons on the side, but the presentation odd. The blistered asparagus was three asparagus with a little egg and bacon bits on top. It tasted fine, but again, we were a little surprised at how little we received. Another thing I will note is that our waiter lacked luster and seemed to not like that we were there for restaurant week. I understand that overall it brings in less money per table, however I did not appreciate being looked down upon for choosing to partake in the restaurant week menu. Overall, The Pink Door is good for special occasions if you want to choose finer dining, but I wouldn't go back any time soon and definitely not for Restaurant Week again.","Dined on April 19, 2016",3,3,2,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

I ended up buying a dessert, only to have the waitress bring a ""taste-size"" dessert out to us with our check.   I thought that was lame, because I would have just had that instead of ordering a $9 dessert.  Bread was excellent.  Water glasses filled and plates brought and given in very good time.

"I have always enjoyed coming to the Pink Door and suggesting it to people out of town. The food and drink are always great. Our service during this last visit started out great, but went south when we asked for a split check. I appreciate that splitting a check during a busy shift can be a pain for a server, but this afternoon was pretty slow. After we asked for the split check, it took a little over 15 minutes to check out. The server continued to serve all tables around us as we waited to be checked out (cards sitting in the small buckets ready to swiped). Instead of helping us, she continued to refill waters and ask other tables if they needed anything.  It was noticeable to everyone as the table and made for an uncomfortable experience.  I had a meeting after lunch and I was almost late due to the long process.","Dined on March 16, 2016",4,5,2,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"It's been years since I've been to The Pink Door which is such a shame.  Everything they serve is absolutely delicious.  I literally cleaned my plate and wasn't overall stuffed.  I started with Insalata Misticanza which was so nice and simple yet so flavorful especially with the fresh herbs in it.  For my entree I had the Pappardelle al Ragu Bolognese which was stunning!  Their homemade pasta was to die for and the sauce was perfect in every way.  I think I could have eaten two servings.

The atmosphere is so charming and fun.  I need to go back sooner rather than later!  Their deck is so lovely in the summer too.","Dined on March 13, 2016",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Just went last weekend with some friends.  We were quickly seated.  Everything about this place was great.  I ordered the lasagna and it was perfect.  I was scraping the cheese off the edge of the dish.  We never felt rushed.  I really want to go in Summer when we could sit outside.  All in all our entire group said they had a great meal.  The cocktails were tasty too.,"Dined on March 11, 2016",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"I went with a friend from out of town. We had no idea what to expect, but every part of our experience was wonderful. Our server was so friendly and attentive. I ordered the pork chop and she ordered steak, and we shared a bit. Every morsel was delicious. The side dishes were presented as thoughtfully as the main dishes. I have already recommended Pink Door to friends. Btw, we were there early on a Thursday evening so there was no scheduled show, but we enjoyed it immensely nonetheless.","Dined on March 11, 2016",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"I thought the food was very good.  I had the lasagna.  I don't typically like lasagna, because I don't care for the ricotta cheese, but fortunately, their lasagna didn't have any of that.   Probably the best lasagna I've ever had.  Service was a little slow, but the restaurant was completely full.   The server did do a good job overall, was very pleasant and helpful.  It is a small place, or at least it felt that way.  I did feel a bit crowded.  But the food is worth it.","Dined on March 8, 2016",4,5,4,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"We had an amazing lunch here , starting with a beautiful daiquiri topped with a sprig of rosemary. We began with some lovely fresh oysters and moved on to a beet salad with arugula, which was divine. Our entrees included the cioppino and the risotto with seafood. The fish was fresh and cooked to perfection. Our waiter was friendly and attentive and the atmosphere transports you away to another time. I would highly recommend this restaurant on any visit to Seattle.","Dined on March 5, 2016",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"I'm a huge fan of Pink doors food and servers, and have been for years.
  That said, I just had dinner there for the 3rd time in the last year. All three times with parties of 3 to 4, for special occasions. All 3 times I have personally requested we be seated on the banquet in the dining room, and made all 3 requests 2 to 3 weeks in advance. 
  My requests have never been honored, so I booked this time with Open Table. We were seated at the last table in the dining room, at the entry to the bar, kitchen next to the service staffs computer stand!!!  A table that should be given to last minute diners. All our seater could say was sorry.
  Again, loved the food and our server... HATED the seating.","Dined on March 4, 2016",4,5,5,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Overall, a wonderful visit.","Dined on March 3, 2016",4,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"As the Pink Door is one of the signature restaurants in Seattle, we had high expectations.  Unfortunately, we were disappointed.  We might have enjoyed the experience more if we were with a group who enjoy drinking. The food was fine, but nothing special and over priced.  The best thing about this restaurant was the ambiance.","Dined on March 3, 2016",2,2,3,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Made a reservation and was immediately seated. The waitress (I forget her name, but she had a short bob haircut) was very friendly and took our orders as soon as we were ready. The food was prepared within 10 minutes and tasted absolutely amazing. The price for the food was a little high, but well worth it. Not to mention the atmosphere, which was very quiet and romantic. Not ideal for large groups, but perfect for date night or an evening out with a couple friends. I wouldn't recommend taking small children (especially with strollers) as it's a bit compact (although not cluttered or anything), and no one likes hearing crying children a few feet away on a date. The Pink Door was everything I had hoped for!","Dined on February 26, 2016",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
Loved the squid ink pasta--one of the best dishes at this restaurant! Osso Bucco was only so-so in flavor. Pesto lasagna was also excellent--probably the best lasagna I've ever had.

"Took my girlfriend for our 1st anniversary dinner.  Staff was attentive but unobtrusive and knowledgeable about the menu.  I had the PACCHERI CON SUGO DI NOCI & SALSICCE, which was excellent.  My girlfriend had the GRILLED KUROBUTA SNAKE RIVER FARM PORK CHOP, which was flavorful, but the chop itself was a little overcooked and dry (although not enough to be sent back).  The desserts were decadent and delicious.  The trapeze artist performed partway through our meal, and was  a delightfully risque and talented addition to our meal.  Overall, a great experience.","Dined on February 22, 2016",5,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"My husband purchased a gift certificate for me months ago for a special occasion.  We are local and live down the street.  We tried several times to get a 7-8 pm reservation for a Fri or Sat evening and it took a couple months to actually secure one of those time spots.  We arrived on a Sat evening.  At first the hostess did not have our reservation, then found it.  We were seated at a table in the middle of the room.  The first few moments our service was good- then a large party came in and our server was done with us.  Other than our water being refilled frequently by a buss er, we were more or less forgotten.  A manager stood in between the lounge area and dining area and it would seem he would have been aware that our waitress was not attentive- not only to us but the other 3 tables around us. He was not- However eventually someone else took over one of her tables.  While the food was good, our table was bumped a lot and basically on top of the table next to us. We had to ask for bread, more olive oil while our waitress was dutiful with the large party-  Due to the way reservations are made it seems management would have been aware of the large party and not given so many tables to our waitress.  Her attention was very devoted to this party.  We had looked forward to this evening for awhile and needless to say we were disappointed.","Dined on February 21, 2016",3,4,2,2,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"OMG! How have I lived in Seattle for over six years and not known about this place? I have now been to lunch here twice, and both times it was superb, and dinner here once. 

Lunch March & April 2015): The food: the house antipasto platter offers a lot of variety and is delicious...even the olive tapenade, which I am not normally a huge fan of, was delicious. The grilled garlic and olive oil bread is a must have, and the house Caesar is well done. I can't resist the pappardelle ala bolognese - some of the best I have had outside if Italy. My BF ordered the fresh fish of the day (Canadian, wild caught, red rockfish) branzino style. This fish was 2 pounds of melt in your mouth deliciousness. It was perfectly prepared, moist, juicy and very flavorful. For dessert we shared the rhubarb crumble, served warm in a mini-cast iron skillet with a dollop of ice cream. Delish! The service: Thomas, who said he was new, was fabulous. Very attentive and knowledgable, and just a nice person all the way around. Ask to sit in his section! 4 thumbs up!

Dinner on January 12: The food: dinner for four and it was ridiculous - so fabulous from the food (especially!), the service and atmosphere. Shared the Antipasto of the House - always a winner. We also had the pappardelle ala bolognese, the osso bucco, the catch of the day, shaved brussels sprouts (2 orders they were so irrisitable!), a side of mama's meatballs and the doughnuts. WOW! All in all, it was 8 thumbs up! The service: Amy was knowledgable, friendly, accommodating and patient! Thank you!

"I went here with my Italian boyfriend who pretty much turns up his nose at the proliferation of ""Italian"" joints here in the states. But as soon as the appetizer hit the table, his eyebrows went up and kept creeping northward. He loved the genuine taste of home! We came for lunch and split the sampler appetizer (only complaint was that there were 3 olives & we totally fought over the last one) and the risotto. I'd love to come back for dinner sometime for their cabaret to see what that's all about. Cozy spot, a bit on the pricey side but you get what you pay for which isn't something you can always say.","Dined on January 5, 2016",5,5,4,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

From the moment we arrived, we were 100% taken care of - the service is impeccable. Our coats were taken and we were whisked to our seats. Our waitress came by right away and was happy to accommodate individual checks. Two of us had sandwiches and two of us split a caesar salad (amazing) and the seafood risotto.

"I came to the Pink Door for my boyfriend and I's 3 year anniversary. Everything was amazing! We started with the calamari (my boyfriend wasn't a fan because he doesn't like seafood) but I found it delicious. I had the beet salad and he had the lasagna pink door (both fantastic). Then we finished off with the donuts. I have 0 complaints. Great food, great atmosphere, amazing and professional  service. I'm definitely coming back here when I visit Seattle next!","Dined on December 18, 2015",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
A gem in Seattle. Very happy I got to visit and eat there. Loved the food and the ambiance. It was busy but servers were on top of their game. I've heard some nights have shows (saw a trapeze hanging from the ceiling). Make sure you have room for a hearty meal. Recommended!,"Dined on December 17, 2015",5,5,4,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
I have eaten at this restaurant for at least 20 years now and this was truly the first bad meal I had here. The fish I ordered was completely overcooked and yes the server took it back and put in a new order but by the time it came back I was done with the sides. And besides the fish was also under seasoned so it eating it like that without the sides had no flavor. This is the more surprising because I just had lunch there a few days earlier with a perfectly prepared fish.,"Dined on December 14, 2015",3,1,4,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Great time at The Pink Door - loved the decor. While it wasn't something to Ooh and Ahh over, the food was great. A fun atmosphere. Our server was pleasant and relatively attentive. Only quibble is that we took their first and really early (for us) seating because Open Table said it was the only time available besides 10 p.m. However, we were there until 6 p.m. and there were plenty of open tables to have accommodated us at our preferred time. All in all a good experience, though, and we would recommend to others.","Dined on November 30, 2015",4,4,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"I took my wife here for a romantic dinner, and was not disappointed. The menu selection is not large but everything sounds good. Our meals were very appetizing.  Service was a little disoganized but overall it was good,  especially for the amount of work they were handling. The only downside was the house red wine I had was warmer than room temperature and borderlined vinegar tasting. Still overall the resturant was not overly expensive and had a excellent food and surroundings. I will definitely go again.","Dined on November 22, 2015",3,4,4,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"The food is mediocre.  We ordered the famous lasagna, clam fettuccine, and garlic bread.   The garlic bread was really good but a bit oily.  The lasagna although quite tasty, definitely does not come close to the best I ever had category.  The fettuccine is pretty average, very pedestrian.   However it was enjoyable to watch a show in the middle of dinner.  The show is about 10 minutes long, definitely an interesting bonus.   The service on site is great.   Very attentive.  However, over the phone not so much.  I got hanged up/disconnected when i call back to confirm the reservation.  When I call back again, the girl over the phone is very impatient and hang up on me again before I can finish my thought. If it wasn't because this is a place earmarked by the wife, I would not have have gone after the phone experience.  Overall so so food, but definitely interesting experience to watch a show.  So if you are into the food and show experience, good to try once.  But if you just want good food, you can skip this place.  Il corvo has way better food than this place.  Not even on the same scale.","Dined on November 10, 2015",3,3,2,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
Great food and service. Our only problem is that we made reservations way ahead of time and still had to wait long. We stopped checking our watches after 45 minutes. They did comp us an appetizer but what is the point of reservations then. We came for the show and only got to watch one act because of the wait.,"Dined on November 9, 2015",3,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"I have lived in the Seattle area for quite some time yet had never been to the Pink Door. It was our anniversary and we wanted something different than the usual so we tried it. Overall the food was good, both of our different wines were wonderful and we liked the atmosphere. 
We went on a Saturday evening so were able to watch the trapeze act. I'm told that they have 3 different trapeze acts a night but we only saw the first one. We had been looking forward to that aspect of going there but were a little disappointed in it. It was very short for one, and for two no trapeze was used in the show that we saw. It was just ok. We have been to many such shows and this was the shortest and most disappointing. Sorry.
On Sundays they have a Vaudeville type of show that we haven't seen and may go back for that sometime.
One note to others who have not been....there is no sign to indicate where the restaurant is outside. You enter from Post Alley and you must look for a kinda pink door to enter the Pink Door. We figured it out the hard way!","Dined on November 9, 2015",3,3,4,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

We enjoyed delicious seasonal cocktails, appetizers and entrees.  Our server was attentive, and we never felt rushed in the slightest.  Food was delivered promptly; everything was timed perfectly.  We had hoped to catch some of the gypsy jazz on the docket for the evening, but since we arrived so early I thought we were going to miss it.  But after dessert, our server filled our coffees and let us know we were welcome to sit and relax--no rush! So we got to sit through the entire first set!

"The dinner experience to be enjoyed at the Pink Door is excellent. From the making the reservation online, the restaurant confirming by phone the day of, and arriving at the unmarked door it was an easy start to our birthday meal. I had made a request on Open Table for the corner table under the stairs, as a review of the restaurant said it was great for a romantic dinner. The Pink Door staff not only gave us the table but placed a special candle for my boyfriends birthday and wished him a Happy Birthday as we sat down. 

We brought wine to drink with our meal and both had the specials of the day, Sea Scallops with polenta and the Seafood squid ink pasta dish. Starting with a half dozen fresh oysters is definitely recommended, they were the perfect size and tasted wonderful with a balsamic pink salt on top. The entire meal felt like we were welcome to stay and linger. The server did an amazing job checking on us without being pushy to turn the table.  

After our delicious meal we finished with a complimentary butterscotch dessert topped with a birthday candle, a perfect finish. Although we weren't able to view the live music that started at 8pm we did still hear it from our seats. Not overwhelmingly loud so we were still able to have a conversation and enjoy the music. 

I would highly recommend the Pink Door to anyone that is looking for a unique Seattle dining experience.","Dined on November 5, 2015",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

It was Halloween, so we don't know how the wait staff is normally dressed, but they should keep Popeye as a regular feature! We enjoyed a nice glass of wine, the Kale salad was a hit, and the entrees were great.  Service was effortless.

My husband had cioppino which he used the garlic bread to soak up the sauce and I had squash ravioli with butter sage sauce. We had the bombolino for dessert and it was fabulous.  I cannot stress how AMAZING this meal was....The only negative would be how close the tables are to one another. There is entertainment which begins around 9 pm.

I had the bolognese and I literally ate every bite which for me is rare but I couldn't help but continue to stuff my face (which you know is a good sign).  The ambience was fantastic.

The restaurant features both indoor and outdoor seating. But we decided to dine inside because of the time of year. Although,  the outside dining has some amazing views of the Puget Sound and Pikes Place Market, the indoor dining had some amazing acrobatic entertainment,  plus a warm and interesting ambiance!

The food was delicious and ample, unlike many upper class restaurants that leave you feeling hungry and over charged.

"We had a lovely late lunch that hit the spot.  The pizza creation varies by day, and we ended up with a slightly spicy sausage and arugula thin crust pizza that was made to order and very tasty.  It was, however, enough to feed two people rather than the advertized ""individual"" pizza, so we ended up taking leftovers (which made an excellent evening snack).  The panini we tried (grilled chicken) was also delicious, though we would really like to go back to sample some of the pasta.  The patio offers a view to the water over the adjacent buildings, and is a nice place to sit on a sunny day, slightly offset from Post Alley.  Some interesting Italian wines were on offer.  The seating on the patio was a little crowded, even despite our mid afternoon meal time on a Monday.  Our servers did an excellent job navigating between the chairs to make sure we were well attended.","Dined on October 6, 2015",4,4,4,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"My wife and I celebrated our 3 year wedding anniversary at the Pink Door.  It was a great experience.  Good food, reasonable prices and pleasant vibe.  The service was good and efficient, but, very basic.  I would have tipped 30% but, he only did the basic's.  Please don't get me wrong it wasn't bad, just not over the top great.

The cocktails we enjoyed were delicious and fun.  The wine we ordered was reasonably priced and paired well with our dinner.

Also it felt like the kind of place that people from Seattle actually go too for dinner, it's not just a tourist attraction.","Dined on September 13, 2015",4,4,3,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"It was my first time visiting Seattle. I had two or three friends recommend this place so we booked a lunch seat on the patio for the day we had to leave for the airport.

Food was amazing. We had the bruschetta with heirloom tomatoes which was only seasonal for the summer. The lasagna pink door was made with spinach pasta so that was awesome (because I'm a spinach lover). Panino wasn't my favorite, but my parents thoroughly enjoyed it. And the linguine with clams was also fantastic, but you've got to eat it while it's warm!

Ambiance was nice. You can see the water. There's a lot of buildings still in the view, but you feel tucked away from the hectic Pike Place Market.

Our waiter was great. He put in all of our orders fast and he was personable and friendly.

I would definitely recommend and definitely return to the Pink Door, hopefully on an evening with the acrobats next time!","Dined on September 7, 2015",5,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"We were unable to visit the pink door last year during our vacation to Seattle so this year we planned ahead. We were hoping to sit on the patio with a gorgeous view, but heavy rain ruined our plans. However, the inside decor was gorgeous and the whole restaurant felt warm and inviting. We had a small seasonal vegetable dish as our appetizer that was DELICIOUS. Somebody in that kitchen knows some amazing secrets to making cauliflower and peppers taste out of this world. We both had pasta dishes that were very flavourful and the portions were definitely good enough for us. The only reason we gave a 4 for overall dining experience was because our server took quite a bit of time to take our order. He came by initially to ask if we were ready to order, but with it being our first time we wanted to take a second to decide. When we were ready I kept trying to make eye contact and we put our menus down to show some body language that we were ready to order. It took him a while to get back to us, but it was also a busy night. It is completely understandable.","Dined on August 30, 2015",4,5,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"This restaurant is special. It's a funky space with a very light pink door. It's bigger inside than it appears from the outside. They have a sweet lattice covered patio that has a view of the water. BUT, at the Pink Door, I would say it's about the food. It's authentic, well prepared Italian food. I personally LOVE the Ciopinno. The bread is good. Caprese salad is fabulous. Very fresh tomatoes.

"Season after season, year after year, the Pink Door is consistently wonderful.  The food is superb.  To start we had bruschetta with thick slices of super fresh heirloom tomatoes sprinkled with salt.  We felt like little kids taking big bites into a juicy candy then crunch, crunch, crunch.  Along with the bruschetta, we had thin sliced tuna with pickled radishes.  Next, Neah Bay Salmon for my husband, and pasta tossed with burrata and sauteed tomatoes with basil for me.  All excellent--bright, fresh, pure Northwest joy.  Mix it all with a bottle of prosecco and perfect service.  Well, it's a perfect summer lunch.  Hope you have the same.","Dined on August 26, 2015",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Ate here about 10 years ago on a recommendation from a friend.  Had a wonderful time.  Was in Astoria, OR for a long weekend.  We extended our stay until Monday and drove from Astorai to Seattle just to eat at the Pink Door since we do not know when, if ever, we'll be in the northeast again.  It was every bit worth the horrible traffic and 5 hour drive that should have only been around 3 hrs.  Sat outside and watched the moon rise over the river.  Their bolognese pasta is the best we ever had.  We wanted to order different dishes since we may never have the chance to visit again, but we decided we just had to have it again.  Plus they are known for their fresh seafood dishes so it was a difficult decision,  however, in the end we were glad we oreded it again.  Great food, setting, atmosphere, and service.  Katrina was awesome.  Despite being super busy we never were left waiting for anything.  One of, if not our all time favorite restaurant.

We recently dined at The Pink Door and enjoyed a lovely meal.  Our group of four ate outside on the rooftop deck. This space is usually uncovered but the weather was questionable so they had the retractable roof covered.  We still could enjoy the lovely view of the water and it was very pleasant outside.  Our waiter was excellent and had a great sense of humor. I had the vegetarian lasagna which was delicious. Our group of four also shared the Brushetta Tomatos and the Anti pasta plate.

The night was going great until we received the check, then it turned amazing because our dinner was comped by the manager, I almost fell of my chair, I did not ask why, I only asked to speak to the manger to give him my gratitude and then we left .  great night and yes the food was very good.","Dined on July 30, 2015",5,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Not easy to locate but it's well known in the neighborhood so just ask! Food is great! Fresh and local ingredients prepared in an unpretentious way!  The only exception is their signature risotto which tastes really sweet and fruity - not my cup of tea so I asked them to change it.

"The food was delicious, and the service was pretty good; although it would have been better if our waiter hadn't forgotten to put the order in for one of the dishes that we had ordered.  At least when we inquired about it after it seemed as though it was forgotten, our waiter was honorable enough to admit that it was he who had forgotten to write that part of the order down and therefore neglected to put the order in for that dish, that it was not a mistake made by the kitchen staff.  It would have been better if he had recommended or offered a remedy, but that did not happen; and we said no more about it.  Kind of strangely, too, the end of our service was provided by other waitstaff.  So perhaps our waiter was toward the end of his shift (we finished our meal between 4:00 and 4:15), and perhaps that's why no remedy was offered which the three of us found a bit odd.  All in all, though, our lunch was very good and well-prepared and fairly-well served.","Dined on July 26, 2015",4,5,4,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"The Pink Door off of Post Alley in the Pike Place Market as been one of my Seattle favorites for many years. During the summer the deck is open and in my  opinion, they have the best outdoor dining deck in the city.  Lunch on the deck is quintessential Seattle. The menu is seasonal but the favorites are always available. Summer crab and corn risotto is one of my seasonal favorites. Creamy and full of fresh dungeoness crab piled on top. Can't go wrong with that one. The other favorite always on the menu is the cioppino. Lots of fresh seafood in a spicy tomato broth.
Yum!

"The most memorable part of the meal was the female trapeze artist who performed over a small clearing among the tables at 35-40 minute intervals.  She was very ""Vegas,"" kind of glitzy and cheesy, and thoroughly entertaining. The chef knows what he's doing too. The isotope was very good and the fennel dusted croutons added a nice something extra to the Caesar salad, which was suffering from a tiny excess of lemon juice. Definitely a fun experience.  Would be great for kids but the food is not cheap and I don't know if there's a children's menu available.

I love this place.,"Dined on July 16, 2015",5,5,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Love going to the Pink Door - first off the simplicity of it's entrance notable only By The Door is iconic.  Upon descending the stairs you glimpse the ambiance of this cool restaurant.

"Loved the Pink Door.  Actually there on a Sunday night for dinner and caught the trapeze act, which I beleive is Sunday and Mondays.  Intimate dining room making it very romantic.  The food was great and fresh, bruchetta, mussels and clams and loved the gelati trio.  They are very accommodating if you are cutting back on your gluten.  All of it was so good we had to go back and this time for lunch on the patio, though the view is limited it's very charming.  Reservations in advance is a must!","Dined on July 10, 2015",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"Our first dining experience in Seattle, hidden down Post Alley and through the Pink Door. Got us seated right away with a great outdoor table with views of the water.

"Will continue to go back . Our server was very informative in the beginning introduction, but seemed as tho he was preoccupied with other things.. Not engaging or smiling. Just simply doing his job.. My prior visit was the total opposite the server was just as great as the food.. We felt as tho maybe we weren't spending a high amount on wine or alcohol that our table wasn't worth talking to.. We watched him laughing and joking with other tables and spending time with them, that's when we knew our feelings were true.","Dined on July 7, 2015",5,5,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"The restaurant is a little hard to find because there's no sign on the door. It's in Post Alley way but even some of the locals don't know what or where it is. That's unfortunate because this place has amazing food and a great outside searing looking towards the pier. The bruschetta with farm grown tomatoes was so delicious and the veggie lasagna was excellent! I was so full but I had to try their tiramisu that didn't have rum in it & oh my god I practically licked the plate. It was so soft and flavorful! Our waiter was nice and attentive & made really good recommendations. I can't wait to go back, this time I'll know exactly where it's at. It's a pink door but at night it looks lighter :)","Dined on July 6, 2015",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"We really didn't know what to expect.  Our waitress was excellent and very patient with our special dining needs.  I had the lasagna.  I usually don't like lasagna from a restaurant (my wife makes the best) but this was delicious and unique.  The cheese was very smooth and creamy and there were some delicious spices making every mouthful a delight.  I ate it very slowly because I didn't want it to end.  The bruschetta was delicious with VERY fresh tomatoes and a flavored (well chosen, not overly bold) olive oil on a softish (not crunchy hard) bread.  

Usually there is entertainment including live music and and aerial act but this was July 4th so it was a little quieter.  Also, there is a burlesque show after 9 on Saturday, but again this was cancelled (not my thing anyway).","Dined on July 5, 2015",4,5,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"Three different people recommended this place so we tried it for my Adult son's birthday.  We were seated right away on the patio, but right in the sun. We asked to be moved and they did so. The view was just a slice of water but I guess for some people that is spectacular.  I asked for a local wine and it was disappointing that by the glass I only was able to select a Sauvignon Blanc. It was fine but at $12 /glass a bit steep.  I ordered the clams/mussel dish in a cream sauce, which was tasty, my son had the salmon dish ,which he said was okay.  For dessert I asked for a gluten free suggestion. The only thing available was a sorbet in Prosecco. It was okay but again choices were limited.  Maybe my expectations were too high due to the number of people recommending this place, but for $100 with tip for the meal, I believe there are better places to eat with great food and prices.  Sorry Pink Door, but my comments won't affect you, but you seem to be doing fine with the lines I saw waiting to get in, but then again that is Seattle and very common no matter where one eats.","Dined on July 4, 2015",4,3,4,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"Sitting on the patio is just so pleasant, with the view of the sound.  The ingredients in the most simple of dishes, from the caprese to bruschetta to clams and mussels, are just so fresh and vibrant. I highly recommend ordering several small plates and sharing, they always have a decent wine by the carafe, as well as good house cocktails and wine list.","Dined on July 4, 2015",5,5,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

We made a special request for a vegan antipasto plate (the regular one has meat and cheese) which was cheerfully provided and delicious.  The service was attentive and very courteous.  The Pink Door is a wonderful experience of Seattle dining all year around, but especially on summer days  on the deck.

We made reservations at the Pink Door for our first Seattle visit.  The reviews were dead on - this was our favorite dining experience during our two week visit.  We ate on the deck.  The atmosphere was great and the scenery even better.  My husband has a gluten allergy.  Our server had a good understanding of the allergy and the Pink Door had wonderful gluten free options.  His meal was excellent.  I had the lasagna which was the best I have ever had.  This is a fun restaurant with excellent meals.  I found the pricing to be moderate as compared with other restaurants in the Seattle area.  Go - you won't regret it.

There were a few traditional entrees (lasagna and pappardelle) as well as some unique offerings (crab, steak, salmon). The dishes were flavorful, cooked nicely, and filling. Sadly, we had no room for dessert but the people sitting next to us seemed to enjoy every one of their dishes as well (including dessert).","Dined on June 29, 2015",4,4,4,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
We booked a reservation ahead and the minute we walked in we were seated even though it was a busy night.  Service was amazing and we had a informative and fun waitress who was clearly devoted to the quality of the food by her descriptions.  She made great recommendations on what was fresh for the day.  We had a linguine and clam dish that had the most amazing light flavors.  Also had a seafood risotto that was notable.  Something as simple as garlic bread was done with a subtle flair that made it way more memorable then it should have been.  Topped the meal off with a rhubarb crumble dessert that was delicious and crowned with a wonderful rich vanilla ice cream.  Sitting outside with a view on a beautiful summer night - this was a wonderful experience.  I would recommend it to anyone who would listen - oh wait - I already have.,"Dined on June 26, 2015",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

The service is wonderful, the food is fabulous and the experience like no other. It is just an all around great experience. Summer time on the patio is so fun! The bar has so much to look at you can just feel the history. The dining room is a cozy feeling that makes you just want to stay.

There are three dining options; the lounge (or bar), the rooftop/deck with views of Puget Sound and the intimate dining room. The entertainment is in the dining room; aerial dancing with rings, swings and scarves...quite a show. You cannot make a reservation using Open Table for the dinning room so beware of this.

"We arrived early for our reservation, were told everything was on time and we would be seated prompetly at 9pm (our reservation time). They escorted us to the bar to wait, where the bartender told us they were clearing the section (for the cabaret they were setting up), we then explained the hostess brought us there to wait. We had a drink and felt anxious with all of the activity going on. At about 5 to 9 I asked the bartender if we should go wait up front, as to get out of their way. She said no, and she would check with the hostess about our table. We were once again reassured we would be seated on time. Well we were seated ten minutes late, of course.

We ended up at the Pink Door, which has a nice outdoor patio with casual tables and a fun atmosphere.  The Cioppino was a hit - but the spinach lasagna was far too rich - made with a béchamel that made it impossible to get through more than ½ the dish.  Had a really nice salad (sorry - can't remember which one exactly) but overall, we enjoyed the visit.","Dined on June 11, 2015",3,3,4,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Enjoyed our time at the Pink Door.  It truly is as other reviewers say, just a pink door along Post Alley with no signage or restaurant name on or near the door.  Surprised we found it as quickly as we did.  We were in the main dining area as there was no room on the outdoor patio.  We were actually thankful for this later when the weather cooled down significantly.  The restaurant interiors are pleasant and it was full when we were there, a lively spot for dinner.  We had the salmon (supposed to be medium rare and was actually medium, but still good) and the mussels/claims/prawns (very good!) with the morel mushrooms and roasted beet salad to start.  Everything was quite good, albeit not super remarkable.  The trapeze artist performed for 6 minutes every hour -- it was unusual and a little hokey, but created a fun atmosphere nonetheless.

We arrived early in the evening (before prime dinner hours), and most of our meal was quiet and calm. The noise level did pick up a little as more people started to arrive around 6:30. We enjoyed our food, and the service was cheerful and attentive.

"Visited The Pink Door while on vacation in Seattle. We were fortunate to experience many great meals while visiting this fabulous city, but this was by far the best. The food was delicious; daughter had the risotto with mushrooms and I had the lasagna (vegetarian). For dessert we shared the butterscotch pudding which was SO yummy...I wanted a second! Dinner was less than $100, for two entrees, a salad, a glass of wine, one shared dessert and a glass of Chianti. As we visited on a Sunday evening, the entertainment was a trapeze artist, during the 1.5 hours of our dining, came out twice to perform. Know this ahead of time...she is performing IN the main dining room which is quite intimate. You can view her from wherever you're sitting, and if you're close by, don't worry that she's going to bump into you...her moves are very controlled. Made for a fun evening. I will definitely return on my next visit, perhaps to enjoy dinner and the show on Friday/Saturday night.","Dined on May 18, 2015",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

The ornate mirrors,  the high ceilings for aerial acts,  and the music of the night (live jazz band on Wed) give the perfect ambiance for the small group next to us or just me and my partner celebrating 10 years.  The food was exquisite.  I ended up with an amazing black pasta seafood dish that had just the right kick to the lamb my partner was in love with. ..my mouth is still watering.

We ordered a few appetizers and a carafe of wine to start. Both delicious. Our entree's arrived promptly and were amazing. I ordered the lasagna as I was instructed by friends that at least one of us had to get it. I was not disappointed. It is the best lasagna I have had to date, and I think about it often. We ordered desert and drinks to accompany. We weren't rushed at all and our server was very friendly and helpful when we couldn't make our own decisions. The couple next to us got engaged during dinner which added to the already romantic atmosphere. This is one of my favorite places in the city.","Dined on May 2, 2015",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"Loved this little hole-in-the-wall restaurant, that's tucked down Post Alley, only identifiable by it's pink door.

However, they did accommodate the kids with simple pasta choices (pasta with butter or marinara) and pizza.  The kids pizza was too ""fancy"" for a kid.  Other than that, lunch was excellent and will return without kids.  :)","Dined on April 19, 2015",4,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

We enjoyed the trapeze show, the food was delicious.  Some of our choices were the kale salad was thinly sliced kale with nuts and raisins, the Pink Door Lasagna which has pesto and bechamel sauce, wild mushroom risotto and the butterscotch budino was the dessert we all loved.

We will be back for that next special occasion.","Dined on April 13, 2015",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"This restaurant was fantastic, down to every detail. The owner, Jacqueline, even gave us a round of drinks on the house, just to thank us for coming in. That spirit is in her servers, hosts, even the coat checker. Must haves: the house lasagna, the oysters on the half shell, ANY of the cocktails, the garlic bread, the spring spaghetti with artichoke.

"The Pink Door takes the unusual approach of not hanging outdoor signs. My hotel could not give me the correct directions to find it.   I found it on line to begin with so I relied on the directions I found there.  It's literally just a plain pink metal door on a nondescript building up an alley way.  Easy to find once you know.
It's worth finding.  It is very well run.  The menu is Italian but not the tired old traditional dishes. The chef makes use of lots of fresh local ingredients. The mushroom risotto was creamy, hearty and really delicious. They used fresh garden peas on the bruschetta, which is something I hadn't thought of before.  For cocktails we had a very refreshing drink made with vodka, limoncello, and a bit of sambuco.  Expensive but very good.
The atmosphere is circus/eclectic. I understand they have cabaret performers in the evening but we were a bit early for that .  You need to reserve ahead for best dinner times.  The Pink Door is a great experience.","Dined on April 12, 2015",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"We had an excellent lunch at The Pink Door!  We shared the kale salad, the rock fish special and mushroom risotto.  Finished it with orange cake. It wasn't cheap, but we thought it was well worth it. Everything was delicious. The side of corona beans, with the fish, we so good I'm going to figure out how to  make them myself. Our server was great, too!  On our way out, she told us to enjoy Seattle, we told her we were both born here!  Must be a rarity!","Dined on April 12, 2015",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Pink Door fits the bill.W had the antipasto for the table and cocktails for the moms and mocktails for the delighted teens. I had the yummy Papardelle.  Wife had delicious lasagna (ok we shared.) I had the muscles and ciappino. Desserts are a must. Great opton forfamilies or a romantic dinner.

"With the description of an aerial trapeze act and the menu, was excited to try this place and wasn't disappointed. As has been mentioned in other reviews if you don't know what you are looking for you might miss this little gem, there are no signs just a pink door that leads down into the restaurant space.

We were seated on a raised area at a table by ourselves with a good view of the performance area. This is a blessing and a curse as it gave a very good view, but when the young lady starts performing everyone that can't see comes to stand around our table area. Now onto the important stuff, the food.

For an appetizer we shared half an antipasto platter. Some, highs and some oks, the mozzarella was ok, but nothing special on the creamy scale, same with the salami, the roasted peppers were perfect, a very nice tapenade, white beans and olive.

For main course wife had the lasagna with beshemel/pesto sauce which was very good. I got the special lamb dish with a polenta cake and a slaw. The polenta was very good, and the slaw was a standout, the lamb was interestingly spiced, but a little on the fatty side.
The stand out of the night was the dessert, an olive oil orange cake. One of the best of the trip.

Our waiter was very good, when I asked about the slaw he went and found out from the chef exactly how it was prepared.","Dined on April 7, 2015",5,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"We tried to make same-day reservations for dinner but couldn't get in (we should have known), so grabbed a lunch reservation time instead.  It was still packed and I noticed a handful of people being turned away - just a sign that this place lives up to its reputation.  Our server was delightful; calm, warm, not overbearing.  My panini was fantastic (great spices/flavor), as was the house wine.  My husband had the lamb and was in heaven with every bite!  We would definitely go back.  Now we know to get a reservation way in advance; we'd love to experience the dinner atmosphere.","Dined on April 5, 2015",5,5,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"I didn't even know there would be entertainment while dining at the Pink Door. I like how tucked away it is, in one of the alleyways, across from Kells.
No sign, just literally a pink door.
I reserved my table for my friend and myself so we sat in a nice portion of the place. It seems there are two areas of seating if you don't count outside.
Where I sat, I had a splendid view of the entertainment of a dancer dancing among silk cords up in the air. I can't think of the name for the act.
The cocktails were delicious.y favorite
Is Seattle Thyme.
I had the oysters which I recommend, they were so good in a balsamic sea salt seasoning.
Overall, I loved it. A great place to treat yourself or take a serious date. It's fancy, there are candles and lively chatter.  I was aware of the pricing so that didn't bother me.
It was $60 for myself but that's because I had a few cocktails, oysters and the Caesar crab salad.
I couldn't even finish it all. It was too much for us to eat all that.

If you want good seating then I recommend you reserve or else you may wait a while or not get a chance to see any of the dancing they provide at certain times in the evening.","Dined on March 24, 2015",4,5,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"We weren't sure whether or not to believe the promise of trapeze artists and such, but there she was, doing a routine on a ring above the floor of the restaurant. We had to leave before round two, which involved long scarves and heights! A perfect complement to the Euro jazz that was playing and the overall decor. All of which was a great complement to the extraordinary food and wine. We had pasta with meatballs and pasta with sausage, and the marinara sauce was to die for. Makes me want to go back and try the bolognese. Next time!","Dined on March 24, 2015",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

My only complaint was it was so hot, we would have loved to sit and enjoy the night longer, but we were both quite uncomfortable with the heat, and the seating. Maybe it was just us, my wife is pregnant which could have added to the uneasiness

While it was a fun experience, I left 50 dollars poorer and still hungry. 
The restaurant was also very drafty and cold. It was a cold day outside, but this made the expensive dining experience a bit less enjoyable.","Dined on March 16, 2015",4,4,3,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"I'm not a professional food critic and Italian food is not my favorite, that being said if you can get me to eat Italian food it must be good!
  I had the long rib and it fell apart on the bone like a good pot roast, the flavor was excellent and what ever concoction the mashed potatoes were made out of I would walk a mile to eat again.
My wife had the Lasagna and she expressed several times that she would order that again, I have never heard my wife say that in 27 years of  going out to eat together.
My daughter ( 22)  had a gluten free pasta salad thing with sausage and I guess it was good but she absolutely flipped  over their gluten free garlic bread. So much so as a mater of fact that we ordered her a side of it to go!
 Another daughter ( 23)  had the mussels and clams and it was excellently flavored.  My Nephew whom came along ( 30 )  had the cioppino pink door  and other then it not containing scallops which he incited it should have ( He is the food critic..lol)  he enjoyed it and the atmosphere very much... This was my birthday and he said "" Good Choice""  so it must have met with his Scientific research criteria.
  Bottom line, everyone would go back in a heart beat.  I rarely...did I say rarely... spend 227.00 for 5 people to eat so this was definitely a  big splurge and a treat for us.. but hey it was my  Birthday  right!....But regardless of that... if  leaving a 50.00   tip on top of that 227.00  is any indication of how pleased we were with the service and the food I will just leave it at that for you to make up your own mind. :)

  OH PS:  They have a wonderful dark beer as well .....much like a porter but they said it was something else.    I had 3....... and  then another good one  at Kell's next door...... then my wife drove us home..:)  Perfect Birthday indeed.","Dined on March 16, 2015",5,5,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

As you could imagine, my significant other and myself spent a lot of time reading over menus of various restaurants across town. Torn between the pink door and another restaurant nearby, we chose pink door because of the beautiful ambiance.

"We were visiting the Seattle area, for a combination of business and pleasure. The Pink Door was recommended by someone who has been a patron, on multiple occasions, and we went with the anticipation that the food would be acceptable. 
We had a cheese plate, appetizer that was beautifully presented, including a fig compote, and honeyed walnuts. 
The classic was the lasagna, which has been on the restaurant's menu for the thirty-three years of its existence. It was one of the best I've had. It was both tender, and tasty. The portion was perfect, and calls for a return visit. 
Service was right there, and not intrusive, which can be a fine line, when going through the dinner.","Dined on March 7, 2015",5,5,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"This place was recommended to us Bostonians by some Seattleites, and it was well worth it! The ambience is very unique: you walk up to--a pink door!--and go down some steps because the restaurant is essentially like a cellar, complete with medieval sconces and grills on the windows. We were there on a Sunday night, which is apparently trapeze artist night, because we were treated to a performance by one! Very unique. 

The food was also good--I got the butternut squash ravioli (excellent) and my husband got the scallops (also excellent). We wanted to try dessert too, but we were too full from our meal. 

Overall, a great experience and we will definitely recommend it to others.","Dined on February 23, 2015",4,4,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Came here with my husband on our first night in Seattle. The Pink Door was recommended by a coworker of mine and I was already intrigued by the fact that there were no restaurant name outside of the establishment. The pink door can only be found by.. well... a pink door! How cool is that. Once we entered the restaurant we are filled with this warm ambience. I could see it was well decorated, candles, chandeliers, flowers, statues, etc... (it was definitely in the small details also). This place was all very romantic and mysterious at the same time. Our server took our orders, and me being a Libra was indecisive on what to get. I first said I'll have the scallops and then changed it to the linguine and clams. The hubby got the slow roasted beef (long-bone). Another server came to give my husband his entree and then gave me mine, except it wasn't the linguine it was the scallops. I told him it was totally ok that I keep the scallops, no need to get the linguine anymore, and boy was I glad I did. The scallops were heavenly! Our original server came back and apologized for the wrong entree, but I told her it was totally fine and I was happy with the scallops. My husband's dish however, was amazing! For some reason, his dishes always seem to be just a little bit better than mine, lol. But it didn't matter, who never minds sharing with me... so I kept picking off of his plate :) I loved the Pink Door and if we are ever in town again, we will definitely be back!","Dined on February 20, 2015",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"I have eaten here a few times since 2007 or so and each time it has not been a disappointment. Most cities have plenty of stuff around the touristy areas but few as good as the Pink Door. The alleyway entrance and the unlabeled pink door lets you know that you're in the right place. The service was vibrant, smart, and didn't constantly interrupt the conversation. Our server tried to let me order off menu, but the kitchen didn't have what I was looking for - a roasted garlic clove appetizer that I get each time I'm in town. Not to worry, the seared scallops and polenta were absolutely incredible. I keep coming back because of the high standards, quick service, and saucy vibe.","Dined on February 20, 2015",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

I had always wanted to eat there, but had never been able to get reservations, so I used OpenTable to secure us a spot. We had the best food I've had in a long time! We split the roasted beet salad (to die for) and the full size antipasto salad (makes my mouth water just remembering it) with bread and wine. OMG, it was wonderful. Our server was very nice and was attendant, the décor was pretty funky, but clean, all and all, a great late lunch!","Dined on February 14, 2015",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Many people have recommended that we dine at The Pink Door ... after 10 years, we finally went. And we were not disappointed! Knowing where to enter was a bit of a challenge since the door is unmarked and it was too dark to tell if the door is actually pink. But once we figured it out, the staff immediately impressed us with their positive, welcoming, and friendly attitudes. Terrance, our waiter, provided excellent recommendations for appetizers, pasta, and side dishes. We found it difficult to call out one dish as better than another. However, we recommend highly saving room for the lemon polenta cake ... amazing! Our total bill for multiple cocktails, and 7 courses was VERY reasonable! We'll definitely return to try different dishes, enjoy live entertainment during the week, and the Saturday night burlesque show!","Dined on February 8, 2015",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Highly recommend starting with hot pot of white anchovies, garlic and olive oil with platter of raw vegetable for starter.   Pink door lasagna was good but shared plate for four of linguini with clams was better.......special of the evening was Sole in Piccata Sauce with fingerling potato's......and for celebrating their birthday being in business....they brought back the 3 custard filled cream puffs covered with dark chocolate sauce.....which can be shared with 3 people but better that you just keep them for yourself.","Dined on February 1, 2015",5,5,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Returned to the venerable Pink Door after a 10 year absence. The location and set up of facilities continues to charm and people watching was excellent; highly entertaining in fact. The restaurant was in full swing with almost 100% seating on this Friday night. Combined with normal restaurant noise, the cacophony made it almost impossible to converse around. The service, food and recommended wine were merely adequate; not up to my expectation or past experiences here. The functioning of the restaurant felt a little off/out of sync; perhaps because of the Friday evening crush of customers. I would like to try the Pink Door again to see if they were merely having an off night.","Dined on January 31, 2015",2,2,3,2,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
We went to the Pink Door for my fiance's birthday. The service was great and I had arranged in advance for a glass of Prosecca (sp) to be delivered to the table once we were seated.

"Horrible service. Came in for lunch with no reservations  for 4 people and was told there were no tables available. However, the host did offer open seating at the back bar. This was ridiculous since the place was apparently empty.  While waiting for service by the bar, I made reservations online. Once reservations were placed, I was immediately  seated to a table. This is quite strange that the place was empty and I had to go through the the hassle of making online reservations to get better seating. In addition, the waitress splashed wine all over my outfit while opening the bottle for us.  Besides the cute ambience, this was a ruined experience by the host and waitress.  Very poor customer service.","Dined on January 25, 2015",2,4,1,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The Pink Door is made especially if you want to enjoy a show. With dinner involved, you get to get best of both worlds. We made a reservation about 8:15pm while we were in seattle trying out dinner in the neighborhood of Pike Market district and low and behold, there was a show that came with our dinner on a Tuesday night at 8:45pm and it was amazing. A lady came and danced and did some aerials moves while we were enjoying our dinner. The dinner on the other hand was quite delicious. The server recommended the special which was a cod with brocolini and ricotta. It was really good and smooth especially since seafood is right near the water next to seattle. They don't even have to import to get fish. I really enjoyed the food while getting to watch the show. 

Parking was free after 8pm if you could find a spot.","Dined on January 20, 2015",5,5,4,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"When you find a place you love, it's an easy decision on where to go for a relaxing afternoon glass of wine and appetizers, or for a spontaneous lunch, or for that special evening in a sumptuous setting.  

The food at the Pink Door is always spot on, as is the service.  I've had most items on the menu and have a few that I revisit regularly (the antipasti - with the freshest tasty morsels and the calamari - done to perfection!).  

On this occasion, I treated myself to the lasagna.  I haven't had it in years because it's pretty decadent!  It was as wonderfully creamy and rich as I remembered it. 

The bar, the lounge, the dining room, or the deck in the summer, each provide their unique Pink Door experience.

From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with smiles, served complimentary champagne, promptly served after ordering, entertained by the trapeze artist, thoroughly enjoyed our main entrée', and delighted with the ""past, present, and future"" candles served with dessert.

"My husband and I had a late lunch at the Pink Door a few days before Christmas. The restaurant really is a hidden gem near Pike Market and close to Central Seattle shopping. The ambiance is European cafe; the menu is mostly Italian. The Caesar salad was made even better with homemade croutons. I had the butternut squash ravioli which was wonderful while my husband had an Italian sausage pasta dish with marinara that he described as average. The service was attentive. Our lunch was accompanied by an aerial acrobatic performance that was good and fun to watch but seemed a little out of place at lunchtime.

"We've been to Seattle many, many times over the last 30-40 years and always enjoy eating at one of our favorite restaurants (Wild Ginger, Green Lake Grill, the old Union Square Grill, Purple Wine cafe and bar, Elliott's for their crab chowder...) and also trying out new ones for variety sake.

I used to write travel reviews and ""where to eat and stay"" tips for various magazines so consider myself to be fairly well traveled and considerably experienced in dining around the world be it in a local food market in Asia, a fish stand on the Isle of Kho Panang, Thailand;  a small out of the way spot in Ankara, Turkey or Rio; to the finest restaurants of the world's major cities...   

The Pink Door is now in our list of top 5 restaurants EVER in Seattle. Great location (near Pike St. Market), excellent ambiance and truly fantastic, diverse cuisine and matching wine list.  The service was equal to the finest restaurants we've dined at (Lutece in New York; Maxim's in Paris, Busaracum in Bangkok; Les Trois Pheasant in Dijon, France; Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Ca.  Whether it's the Pink Door's marvelous beet salad, the wonderful lasagna, or an entree like their Cioppino or Grilled Lamb long shank the food is exceptional both in terms of presentation and quality.

Oh, and the PD's burlesque show is a terrific experience and one that should not be missed!  It's in high demand, so book ahead of time if you want to add that to your overall experience at the Pink Door.","Dined on December 14, 2014",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"I live/work in Berkeley, CA and I LOVE this restaurant.  The first time I went was with a large convention group.  Loved the meal & was too full for dessert.  But, I saw something on the menu that caught my eye;  a Budino made with butterscotch -  I believe.  I ordered it thinking that I would share it, but no!  I wanted it all to myself!  It is my favorite dessert ANYWHERE - hands down.  I recently flew to Seattle to visit family and I made reservations here for dinner.  I called several days before to confirm the reservation and begged that they have the Budino on the menu Friday.  Sadly, no such luck.  But my family loved the dinner - and so did I.  I wonder if I will ever have the Budino again?  Oh, the service is wonderful and the atmosphere festive and comfy.  A bit noisy but you can still have a conversation at a table for 6.","Dined on December 13, 2014",5,4,4,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Came back here for a 3rd time. Got the best table in the corner and our server was great. Made good recommendations and took the time to give us attention yet still be discreet. 

Food was terrific with the prosciutto and the roasted garlic. Gnocchi with pumpkin was delicious but personally we felt could have done without the hazelnuts. The rabbit ragu 
was sensational. Best dish of the knight.  

Server bottled our wine to take home and enjoy. Overall a great experience. We'll be back for sure.","Dined on November 23, 2014",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Our server for dinner was very attentive and engaging and made spot on recommendations for our meals and wine.  We will go back to experience more selections from their menu.  The only negative was the large group we were seated next too as they were very noisy, but I assume that was an anomaly.","Dined on November 20, 2014",4,5,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"We were directed to the Pink Door by many friends and the concierge at our hotel ""The Inn at the Market.""  After making an online reservation, we walked down the alley to a pink door.  No sign here…thank goodness we were told about the restaurants location or we might have missed it.  we arrived to find a completely charming restaurant.  The atmosphere was warm, inviting and the host/hostess were quite friendly. After siting down at a table in the lounge, and talking with the very friendly waitress, we ordered the pumpkin gnocchi and the cioppino.  Fantastic is not a strong enough adjective to describe how wonderful our meal was.  From the bread, to the very strong drinks, to the delicious main courses, to the amazing entertainment we were extremely impressed.  Needless to say, we will definitely be returning upon our next visit to Seattle!","Dined on November 15, 2014",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

We received our mains before our appetizer and I'm not kidding you we had our meals on our table no more than 10 minutes after we ordered.  We were finished our meals before the wine.

Our meal, though, was wonderful.  We shared a salad and calamari appetizer followed by Cioppino for me and lasagna for my husband.  Both were excellently spiced. The service as outstanding.

"We went to the Pink Door for a romantic dinner for a special occasion.  It was difficult to find as there was no signage, and a garbage truck in the alley, making us nearly miss it.  Once inside, it was an eclectic whimsical environment and very lively. I had heard there was going to be a trapeze artist performing at 8:45.  Our reservation was at 9:00 and was disappointed to learn that her performance was at 8:45 for 4 minutes and it was the last performance of the night.  In any event, the dinner was pricey but was excellent.  I would definitely return for a special occasion.","Dined on October 28, 2014",4,4,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

It's a shame that restaurants can't lessen the amount of salt they use in their dishes.  My husband and I both had the linguine with clams which had prosciutto.  There was too much of it hence the saltiness.  A. little goes a long way and a dish that is salty becomes overwhelming and loses any subtlety.  Our server was cheery and aimed to please.,"Dined on October 24, 2014",3,3,4,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

And among all the food recommendations, if we are ever back in the Seattle area, this would be the one place we would DEFINITELY come back to (for the lasagna!!!).  The lasagna may be the absolute best we've ever had - delicious homemade noodles and the pesto inside was so good.  The pappardelle bolognese was good, too; however, it was served room temperature...  The service was only okay.  Not the friendliest.

"Unusual atmosphere, tables were very squished together and the waiters hardly had space to walk and serve.  Another reason it seemed too noisy,  you could hear everyone talking loud around you.  The Caesar Salad and the wild mushrooms on polenta appetizer were very delicious, but the risotto with crab was just o.k. and the Linquine with clams was soooo salty I returned it twice and ended up not eating anything else for dinner.  Good for a first experience, but one time was enough.","Dined on October 17, 2014",3,3,3,2,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"After reading so many good reviews of this place I went to try it. I have no idea why people rave about this place. The most important thing, the food, was nothing special. The coppio broth tasted like spicy water. The risotto tasted like four cheese rice a roni with ragu in it, and barely had any crab mixed in. The ambiance is cool if you get the right table. They tried to squeeze us in a table practically in the center of the room where you are constantly getting hit by all the people coming through. Then you go outside to sit on some dinky metal chairs that hurt after about 20 mins. I'm a foodie, I love great food, but there are far better dining places in Seattle including ones focused on Italian cuisine.","Dined on October 11, 2014",2,2,4,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"I come here almost every time I'm in Seattle and I have never been disappointed. The caprese (summer only) salad is divine, the antipasto plate is humongous and delicious, the beet salad is perfectly balanced. They do great with meats and their pasta is homemade and delicious. The potato gnocchi are amazing (semolina gnocchi are nothing to write hime about). And the desserts are also wonderful. They even have gluten free pasta for my wheat-sensitive daughter! And they only serve good wine, and the specialty cocktails are pretty much always winners.","Dined on October 10, 2014",5,5,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

While the scallops when excellent, the salmon special was good - outstandingly cooked med rare however the salmon tasted bland....it needed more spices like smoked paprika, parsley, crushed pistachios all in melted garlic butter and glazed over the salmon as it cooks.

The place had a nice view of the lake/sea, had a gypsie-ish vibe to it,  food was very generously proportioned and great to top it all off, the service was fantastic! The only drawback I can think of is the location can be very tricky to find and traffic is horrible around the area. But that is kind of expected as it was right next to Pike Place Market. It was all worth it though!","Dined on September 28, 2014",5,5,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

We almost didn't find it as it is located in the Post Alley of Pike Place Market and if you miss the door, you may miss the spot. It's more of a coral/peachy color and definitely not pink.  BUT WHO CARES?!  Food was delicious.  If you can - get a table on the deck/patio as it over looks the water. 

We started off w/the cheese board and it was a nice starter as they give you 4 different cheese, 4 different spreads/nuts/etc to try.  Make sure you order extra bread!! 

I had the crab risotto.  It was delicious and they are not cheap w/the crab.  Risotto was very creamy and cooked perfectly.","Dined on September 27, 2014",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"On a recommendation, we had our first meal upon moving to Seattle one Monday night. Needless to say, we may have set the bar too high to begin learning this fantastic town. The ambiance is the right kind of busy with indirect lighting and mirrors among antiques in a dimmed, intimate setting. The menu is solid for Italian. Do the lasagna, don't think twice. Add a pair of hefty meatballs if you must carne. Caprese and risotto were also incredible decisions. We will be back.

"I took my boyfriend here for his 21st birthday. We got there a bit early and they said that they would prepare a table for us, so a hostess lead us to the bar. There were no seats and she said to just sit on the stage, but it was very awkward and people were laughing at us, so we went to a different host and he seated us outside. It was a bit chilly but they offer blankets, which I thought was very nice! We had the meatballs as well as the bruschetta and the steak, plus chocolate cake for dessert. Everything was delicious and perfectly seasoned! The service was a bit slow, but very good considering how packed the place was. Definitely recommend making reservations if you want to get into this place. Overall a lovely experience!","Dined on September 1, 2014",5,5,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"It's been a couple of years since I last remembered to dine at The Pink Door, and gosh, have I been missing out! I'd forgotten how well-prepared, fresh and tasty everything on the menu is, and what a treat it is to dine overlooking the Market at Elliott Bay.  

The online reservations are for their tables outdoors (seasonal), so if you reserve via OpenTable, voila-- you have a table outdoors! I was a little worried about sitting outdoors as the sky was a bit gray... worry not! The first tiny drops of rain brought out a nearly-invisible sliding awning-- hidden behind the latticework overhead-- to keep us warm and dry even while it sprinkled around us.

The Pink Door is a treat: and try the cioppino-- it's Northwest-fresh, tasty & perfect!","Dined on August 29, 2014",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The Pink Door has long been a favorite for Seattle funky style, great food, anda rareplace with a nice view right in the middle of Pike Place (where you might think there would be more places that fit this bill).

"Not our first time at Pink Door, but few times better than August: great weather for outdoor seating and heirloom tomato season are tough to beat.  Whether it's in bruschetta or caprese salad (our choice), heirloom tomatoes are to be savored.  Likewise, some of Seattle's best meatballs are great in a sub or on the side (the latter this time, but both are winners).  Crab/sweet-corn risotto was ""heaven in a bowl,"" according to my wife, and GF, too (one of several GF offerings).  The wine list offers many options, but for lunch we usually go with a half-carafe if house wine and have ever been disappointed.  Reservations strongly recommended, even if you're arriving at opening.","Dined on August 26, 2014",5,5,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"I am a gluten-free vegetarian. Therefore, I appreciate that Pink Door offers gluten-free pasta. Even so, there was only one vegetarian pasta dish offered with mushrooms which I dislike so I ordered something else when I looked forward to having pasta. It would be nice to have had a second choice. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the beautiful view, good service and quality food. I just wanted pasta instead of the panini that had a tasty filling but made with Udi's bread.","Dined on August 23, 2014",4,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"Sure enough, just as the website says you will not find a sign saying you've arrived at the right place, just a pink door in an alley. Cutting to the quick, excellent service, a noisy, boisterous atmosphere full of energy - exactly what one would expect at a good Italian restaurant.  The food was superb, my wife having oven baked lasagna and crab risotto fort myself. Our appetizer was bruschetta but not an ordinary one at that. Thick sliced heirloom tomatoes, sweet and full of flavor on garlicky sliced ciabatta (I think) drizzled with olive oil and fresh chopped basil. The lasagna was delicious, the risotto cooked perfectly. The only complaint was the corn and grape tomatoes in the risotto were so sweet as to detract from the crab. Poor me!","Dined on August 22, 2014",4,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Our waitress Elyse was amazing – great sense of humor but never intrusive; always on top of our needs. And we indulged in super food – the tuna carpaccio was a standout; our entrees of scallops, lamb and the pasta of the day were excellent; and everything was rounded out by delightful wines and desserts. Thank you, Pink Door, for giving three long-time friends who explored Italy together 12 years ago an evening that transported us back to that fantastic trip.","Dined on August 21, 2014",5,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"This Pink Door was recommended by a friend whom has dined here before. We were on our way back home to Vancouver, BC from a Portland, OR road trip and made a pitstop in Seattle for lunch.

The restaurant is located on Post Alley in the Pike Place Market area, similar to Granville Island in Vancouver. It also has outdoor patio seating. I had the Vegetable Lasagna while my girlfriend had the Seafood Spaghetti.

The food is decent with moderate portions, not the typical Amercan, obesity-inducing, super-sized portions like one usually sees in the States. This place seems like it would be more popular with the tourists than with the locals. It's a casual atmosphere serving Italian appies, pasta, one pizza, meat and seafood entrees. It was okay.","Dined on August 21, 2014",3,3,3,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"Very disappointed with the meals. Smallest portion of vegetables I have ever received, and they were cold and pickled. Served flat beer but was given the last dregs of the barrel free. Lamb was very salty although well cooked. My wife's chicken meal was OK. Would not recommend this place. My poorest meal of the holiday. Only gave two stars because my wife's meal was ok.","Dined on August 20, 2014",2,2,3,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"I made a reservation over 3 weeks in advance for a Wednesday night and requested to be seated outside on the patio. The day of, I confirmed that I wanted to be seated outside and when we showed up at 7:48 for our 7:45 reservation, the hostess said she had already marked us as ""no show"" and given away our table. We were placed in the back of the dining room so we could not see the patio or even the band. This was extremely disappointing since it was my birthday and I had made reservations so far in advance.

She made good suggestions and we tried several different items, all of which were delicious. The bruschetta and caprese appetizers were excellent and included large slices of the best tomatoes we have ever eaten (the bruschetta did not have diced tomatoes, but sliced) flavored gently with herbs to bring out the natural taste. As mains, three of us had the lasagne, the cioppino, and the Pappardelle Al Ragù Bolognese and each was delicious and delicate with robust but not over-powering flavors.

"This is very good but not great food, but given the quantities (huge appetizers) and prices it is well worth a trip.  The food is fresh, and somewhat creative - the olive oil with the bread, for example, is noteworthy.  We shared a grilled calamari appetizer and it was the highlight of the meal.  The pasta fruiti de mari, by contrast was relatively bland despite the description.

The food is fantastic and the staff were very attentive and great at giving personally based food and drink suggestions.  The late night entertainemnt really adds to the special feel of the Pink Door.  Friday nights are better for music and cool 1960's tunes.  Saturday night has the burlisque show that is unique.

We ordered a crimini mushroom, barata and squash blossum flatbread, a new york strip steak, linguini and clams and closed with a nectarine crostini with vanilla gelato.  This is not a steak house and yet this was the tenderest and best seasoned strip steak we may have ever tasted.  The view was brilliant looking out onto Puget Sound at sunset.

"Even though my dining partner was 45 min late, the staff was friendly and attentive. I had a wickedly dirty martini and some antipasto, and they brought me the gluten free bread and extra fresh mozz I asked for.

"We had a lunch date at the Pink Door to celebrate our 10-year anniversary. We enjoyed a lovely spot in a quiet part of the outdoor dining area, despite there being a fairly large crowd the day we visited. The food was top notch, as usual. Excellent service, terrific food, and reasonable prices.  Try a fresh peach crostata to finish your meal--DELICIOUS! You can't beat the view or the ambience. We'll be back!","Dined on July 18, 2014",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"Our reservation was made for the wrong time on open table and when I received a confirmation email I called the restaurant and te manager politely informed me that the deck was booked but they would find some space for myself and my date. They did! And it was a lovely corner table w an unobstructed view if the sound. 
Our server was friendly, unobtrusive, made lovely suggestions (the heirloom tomatoe bruschetta was amazing) and kept the drinks coming. All in all a 4.8 out of 5 star experience.","Dined on July 17, 2014",4,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Our waitress was absolutely wonderful and really enhanced our dining experience.  She was super knowledgeable about the menu and made great recommendations for appetizers and desserts.  The cheese plate was spectacular - highly recommend.  And the Nectarine dessert was simply out of this world!  The entree's though... well, disappointing.  There were 5 of us, and none of us loved what we ordered.  I got the scallops and they were not good... too much sauce on the plate, hard green beans with cold, gross white sauce on top, and a very bland potato type thing.  Also, and this may sound petty, our table cloth was ugly...  We ate on the patio, and if I were to go back, I'd sit inside and hopefully get the same great waitress.","Dined on July 15, 2014",3,2,5,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"This place just isn't worth the price and we are used to spending significant money on dinner.  It's just ok.  the Risotto was good but advertised as having crab.  there was one bite of crab in the dish.  The salmon was overcooked and we didn't sent it back because on the advice of the waiter we ordered it medium rather than medium rare...he basically said it would be bloody if we ordered it medium rare.  The almond chicken was also overcooked and a bit dry and even a litte burned.  The wine just wasn't good...an $89 bottle of Amarone that wasn't even close to worth the price.  It was wine, but just not a good choice for the menu and seemed really overpriced for the taste.  The waiter seemed nervous and not really knowledgeable.","Dined on July 11, 2014",2,2,2,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The evening got off to a rocky start when one of the water glasses arrived at the table with food crusted on the side.  I ordered the Calamari app., but I am not sure what I got.  It was long pieces of some seafood (the size of slender hand cut fries) with spinach in a Marinara.  It was OK, but definitely not like any Calamari I have ever had.  Entrees ranged from pretty good (my Pappardelle al Ragu Bolonese (well cooked and with a nice flavor) to Rigatoni and Mama's Meatballs (chewy -definitely not al Dente - pasta with weird tasting meatballs).  It was like the episode of Everybody Loves Raymond where Marie gives Debra the wrong spices to make her signature meatballs.  These were what Debra must have produced.  We skipped dessert.","Dined on July 7, 2014",2,2,3,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"To start at the beginning, the reservations were very easy and I was given a chance to pick where I wanted to sit. This is the perfect place to go for a nice date. The food was delicious, the waitstaff was helpful and attentive, the atmosphere was very romantic, and the menu was slightly erotic. The novelty of a trapeze performance (only on Sundays) easily set the date apart. The pricing is very good compared to other resteraunts of similar nature, not to mention the location in pikes place allows for plenty of fun after dinner activities.","Dined on July 7, 2014",5,5,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The Pink Door used to be a classy and cool place to go to dinner. It was good for a romantic occasion. Not anymore. It's way too loud, and there's no expectation for how people should dress. There were people there with their baseball hats on (backwards) and wearing flip-flops!  This is certainly not what I was looking for when I made a reservation to take my girlfriend out for her birthday dinner. We will not be back....

The ambience outside was festive, casual and scenic   As the evening was cool, we asked to be seated indoors, Elyse was quick to offer us blankets if we needed it.  The food was delicious and good value for the money.  The breaded razor clam appetizer, the squid ink pasta with mixed seafood and the braised lamb shank was scrumptious.

"Even though the Pink Door is too close to the center of tourism, they offer outstanding meals at a fair price. 

We had King Salmon, a beet salad and wild mushroom pasta. All three were spectacular. The salmon was perfectly crusted and also raw in the middle.  Simply prepared with just a touch of salt. Perfect for a great piece of fish. 
The beet salad was sweet with both pink and red beets, almonds and Feta. The flavors came together perfectly and it was light and refreshing.
The pasta was really spectacular.  Mushrooms and cream sauce came together with a special added ingredient that puts a POW at the end of each bite. Try to figure it out without peaking.

We can always be sure that our lunch at Pink Door will be memorable. The ambiance makes us feel that our lunch will be more special than the other restaurants. The menu makes it hard to make a decision what to order because I want everything. I never seem to be at Pink Door on a sunny day to enjoy the outside dining but dining in is okay too. The wait staff knows just what to do to make us feel  that they care that  all our needs are met. This is one restaurant that I always leave feeling that cannot wait to be at Pink Door again soon.,"Dined on May 24, 2014",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

The Pink Door is a great dining experience. I have been there many times and the food and service is always top notch. The restuarant itself is beautiful and perfect for a romantic dinner or for a few freinds who want some great food. It's a mix of great Italian and seafood and the puddings are delicious. Wine can be inexpensive or you can treat yourself with something decadent. The burlesque/cabaret show is very entertaining - a little risque but never smutty. Try it once and you will definately go more times.,"Dined on May 22, 2014",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

When reading about the resturant we got the impression that entertainment happened nightly. Made reservations for a very special birthday celebration and when we arrived were disappointed to find that there is only entertainment in the weekends.

"We have eaten a number of times before at the Pink Door. Always enjoyed going there. We usually sit in the lounge. This time we had reservations for dinner in the main dining room. While the food was good, albeit the portions smallish, I felt that they were rushing us in an effort to turn the table. I did not appreciate the lack of attention or the rushed service. I will re-think going back, and if we do, I will probably not sit in the dining room.","Dined on May 18, 2014",3,3,2,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"We were able to get a table on the porch, and I highly recommend it.  Seattle is a city of amazing sight lines, and The Pink Door is well situated to take advantage of that.  Menu is small but everything we had was done very well. They even had a number of Gluten Free  options, which is amazing considering how much of the menu is pasta.  And the carnivore at the table will be very happy with the lamb shank, I promise.   Nice variety on the cheese board.","Dined on May 15, 2014",5,5,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The server was excellent he was very attentive but also subtle about it - not over powering, didn't hover. The menu had so many delicious-sounding entrees i had a hard time choosing. I ended up selecting the risotto and it was superb. The dessert was good and the coffee was excellent - fresh, hot & robust. The entertainmnet was the topping on the cake, so to speak what a graceful and lovely young artist/athlete. LOVED every part of my dining experience. The pace was leisurely and relaxed - we left raving about the experience amongst ourselves and will continue to spreadthe word about this hidden gem in Post Alley.","Dined on May 6, 2014",5,5,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"What a wonderful experience! Absolutely love the atmosphere and service. Everything from the moment you enter and being greeted tells you, you are welcomed and treasured here.They will hang your jackets, have a basket for umbrellas, and everyone in the restaurant smile sincerely. I guess they love and appreciate their job.  And let me tell you about the food...it is the best that you can find in Seattle (on the same level as El Gaucho, but more affordable prices and casual atmosphere).  Every dish has a unique presentation and done just right! Dessert menu has a great selection, and please order the cabaret cake with slated caramel. It is to die for!","Dined on May 5, 2014",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"You start by wandering down the alley filled with flowers and outdoor patios.  You note the pink door, open it, and make your way down the stairs into a dimly lit Italian seafood restaurant.  It was everything we were hoping for!  Our waitress was friendly, knowledgeable  and appropriate in her suggestions.  The fresh Penn Cove oysters were the best ever!  The salmon and scallops tasted delicious!  To top off the evening our waitress suggested the Espresso Semifreddo, explaining how it was made and she hit a home-run there!  Wonderful time!","Dined on May 3, 2014",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"They have a nice patio with a latticed roof so not has much direct sun, but still plenty of it.  Make a reservation ahead of time, or call directly to find out their seating strategy.  It used to be first-come-first-served for outdoor seating, but on the day we went, anyone with a reservation automatically got priority outside seating.  It's amazing how few restaurants downtown have outdoor patios.","Dined on May 1, 2014",4,4,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"We had a lovely table in the front portion of the deck overlooking the scenic waterfront. The weather was perfect. The wait staff was kind and patient as we asked about menu items and placed our order. In reading reviews for the Pink Door a comment that kept coming up was the small portion sizes. It's true; they are. The pricey pasta dish my husband ordered would qualify as a ""half order"", if one was offered. It was certainly not a full sized portion. We ordered dessert as a result, which turned out to be a memorable thing indeed. A cherry almond tart with vanilla gelato. Delicious!","Dined on April 30, 2014",4,3,4,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"We went to this restaurant after reading the reviews. While we were walking through Pike Market we noticed the sign for the Pink Door, I had no idea it was in the middle of the tourist traffic. I would normally stay away from restaurants in the middle of tourist area. I am so glad we decided to go. There was a jazz singer and 4 piece band playing in the lounge, really great music at the perfect noise level to enjoy and still talk normally to each other. The food was delicious. I took everyone's advice on the lasagna and my husband had the peppercorn crusted rib-eye, very tasty. The lasagna is definitely not traditional but worth trying at least once.","Dined on April 23, 2014",4,4,4,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"Whether it's your 24th or 100th birthday, The Pink Door literally opens up into a whole new world. Imagine ""Casablanca"" hidden in an alley way of Seattle- that's how I felt and it was magical. I was there with my sister and our boyfriends- toasting with champagne, sharing mouth watering food, listening to my all time favorite jazz songs- and felt so at home because our server, Dominic, was practically perfect in ever single way! Overall, highly recommend The Pink Door and I definitely plan on going more often!","Dined on April 23, 2014",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"I say hidden, because if you are in the back alley trying to find the door, it's almost impossible!  I love this place, we've been three times, and we live in Calgary - it's kind of a Must Do when you're in Seattle.  The entertainment is what makes it really special, but we missed it this night, we were too late.  The food as always, great.  What can I say?  I'm always impressed by The Pink Door.","Dined on April 22, 2014",4,3,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

Best lasagna I've ever had but some of the worst service I've ever had at a nice restuarant. Waitress brought it was sparkling water when we asked for San Pellgrino. She tried saying it was the same and that there wasn't actually San Pellgrino and it was basically the same thing when we didn't budge because we wanted something flavored she said she could bring out orange flavored sparkling juice. When she brought it out it was San Pellgrino. When it came for the check the waitress brought it out then never came back and the air conditioning got turned on so it got really cold. We eventually got up because we thought maybe we had to pay up front. After that our check got taken care of real fast but we still missed our bus from slow service.,"Dined on April 20, 2014",3,5,2,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"We went to The Pink Door for dinner, a celebratory date night after my husband finished his exams. I had read many reviews that talked about really good food and atmosphere. So I made a reservation about 3 weeks in advance. We arrived precisely on time and then we were seated, at the worst table possible. We asked to be moved and they had to think about it, said it may not be possible even though there were empty tables. 
Then we ordered wine and they served it in tumblers. Not really want you want when celebrating a special night. So we asked for real wine glasses, like half the other tables were using. Our server was nice but that is about all I can say. She did nothing wrong but certainly did not go overboard with hospitality. Good food.","Dined on April 19, 2014",3,4,2,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"Dined with hubby and another couple for Seattle Restaurant Week, and had a wonderful time. Food, service and atmosphere were impeccable. The Pink Door is very romantically lit and laid out, the live music complementary to table conversation, and the food artfully prepared and presented, without the snobbery of other like-fine restaurants. Our server and I miscommunicated over my wine order and she attended to it very graciously. We are eager to return on a weekend to see the trapeze entertainment!","Dined on April 18, 2014",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"This was our first time eating at The Pink Door. We were 2 couples celebrating my husband's birthday before attending a concert. We scheduled dinner for 2.5 hours before the show & that allowed us just the right amount of time to have a meal without rushing. My husband and I had the cheese plate, salumi plate, pasta with bolognese sauce and meatballs, and the flourless cake with caramel sauce and espresso cheesecake for dessert.  All items were excellent, especially the desserts!  This was a prix fixe meal for $28 per person, a real bargain!  My husband also included the wine paring option for $10 (4 glasses of wine).  The acrobatic show only happens Sun/Mon, so plan accordingly. We will just have to come back!","Dined on April 17, 2014",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

We had such a nice experience and delicious dinner during Seattle Restaurant Week in April. It really is an iconic must experience for Seattlites.

"Found the Pink Door on the list of Seattle's Restaurant Week and selected it because of the menu and location. Loved all of our dishes-lasagne, risotto and the ahi tuna. As well, the cheese plates and salumi were VERY tasty! The bits of dessert - flourless chocolate cake, espresso cheesecake and pavlova were perfect in their preparation and while I initially thought the servings were small, they were just right due to their rich flavor.

We saw some ""regular"" patrons next to us order a antipasto plate that looked amazing! We WILL be back to enjoy that and other menu items-I am so glad that the Pink Door participated in Restaurant Week as now we know a nice restaurant with a great view (this time of year) and delightful menu.","Dined on April 15, 2014",4,4,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"My boyfriend and I went here for dinner, and it was great. Very romantic, attentive service, amazing atmosphere. My only complaint is when we ordered our dinner our waitress asked us if we wanted anything with our entres. She mentioned a salad and a couple other things I can't recall. So we asked for two side salads to later find out we got charged $9 for each salad. We were under the impression it came with the entree with the way she worded it. We were a little put off by that. That's the only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars. I'd still go back.","Dined on April 13, 2014",4,4,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

But once you're there, the place has such a great personality and the food tasted authentic and different. You start with celery with olive oil, and their calamari was sauteed.

This was a fantastic atmosphere, great food and just a overall wonderful dining experience. Somehow they have an intimate dining set up that doesn't make you feel like you're sitting on your neighbors lap even though the tables are really close together. also, we were so pleasantly surprised because we decided at the last minute to go to dinner on a Friday night. We got on their website at 6:30 PM, got a reservation at 8 and when we arrived at the restaurant we were seated immediately.

"I took my long time friend, who was new to Seattle to this wonderful restaurant. We were both impressed with the food and the service. The waiter was very knowledgable and engaging. We had a great time!","Dined on March 28, 2014",4,4,5,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"If you didn't know where and what it was, you'd never find it, but I don't think it's a problem for them.
This is a really unique restaurant, in a cellar, but so eclectically elegant.
Tables were close to each other, yet you could have a conversation.
A great find!","Dined on March 27, 2014",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
The Pink Door came recommended to us by friends and did not disappoint. The food and service was great. Truly a gem and we will be back for sure.,"Dined on March 26, 2014",5,5,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"How odd to have a restaurant without signage....beware! Hard to find, but worth the effort and then not something you'll soon forget. Be sure to make a reservation to avoid disappointment. Most every night they have entertainment, but it doesn't start until later - you may want to choose your dining time accordingly.
Service was exquisite and caring.....cheez plate appy to die for! What a great experience.....wished we lived nearby....we'd be there again and again!","Dined on March 26, 2014",5,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
My friends visiting from California and Connecticut felt special and enjoyed their time at the Pink Door. The food was delicious and the wine was excellent. Our waiter was attentive and had a great sense of humor. We will definitely come back again!,"Dined on March 26, 2014",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
Romantic setting with light music in the background. We were lucky enough to see an incredibly talented trapeze artist. Great place to hangout with your loved ones. Awesome food and fast service. Will definitely go back.,"Dined on March 25, 2014",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"What a fun last evening for a vacation. Wonderful food,impeccable service and very unique entertainment. We will definitely come back.

This place was great and delish! I would recommend the lasagna with a glass or red wine. Inside setting was beautiful and very calm. Was dinner down with a pink lady drink~ YUM! Can't go wrong here!!!,"Dined on March 24, 2014",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"the food excellent. however, we really wanted to go for the entertainment aspect,but when we arrived we were told that the trapese artists are only on sundays and mondays, and burlesque seating is a first come first serve with a line out the door starting at 10:00pm. the website was not clear about this.","Dined on March 23, 2014",3,4,3,2,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"Took my daughter here for a graduation-from-college lunch, and she loved it. Great atmosphere and perfect service. We had a variety of dishes and all were delicious, though my lasagna was nothing special (mostly cheese and pesto, with no vegies). My sister said the cioppino was perfect - not rubbery like most places. The beet salad was fantastic, as were the meatball subs. Excellent bread served with lunch, and we immediately went out and tried to find some just like it in the Market. No luck, but you can ask - I think it's sold in Pioneer Square. Overall, a really wonderful lunch in a funky atmosphere, and we will be back!","Dined on March 23, 2014",4,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"Lovely interrior with a hint of hideaway location, lovely tasty food that comes out in timely manner, and servers always attentive without being pushy or interfering. Slightly on the higher side of $$, but well worth it especially for brunch!","Dined on March 22, 2014",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"The food was outstanding, amazing, exquisite!! The oysters on the half shell were the best we have ever eaten and to die for! Can't wait to get back to The Pink Door!!","Dined on March 18, 2014",5,5,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"Dined there recently at the recommendation of many locals. The food was ok, not anything really wow, but where else can you dine while having a trapeze show overhead. I would do it once but I don't anticipate it being one I would return to should i be in the area again.","Dined on March 17, 2014",3,3,3,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
I love the pink door! We brought our kids (4&1) and still love this place. Everyone was super nice to our kids but the setting would be more ideal for a date night. The food was amazing and we will definitely return soon.,"Dined on March 15, 2014",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"We are from Vancouver,BC. The Pink Door was on a food segment during a KOMO tv newsbroadcast.We had been planning a daytrip to Pike Place Market anyways,so had been wondering where to have lunch.It was definetly worth going to this restaurant.The food was delightful.Service attentative and friendly.Would highly recommend this restaurant to any and all.We'll be back.

"This place has tremendous character and charm, the food was exquisite, quality service without any feeling of snobbery, and any place that can achieve all that while you are graced by the skills of a talented aerialist is worlds away from any place I've ever eaten before. The entrance teases you. I promise it's worth the price of admission.","Dined on March 11, 2014",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"We went to the Pink door for dinner only. Terence was our server and he was the BEST server we have had at a restaurant. He was attentive, knowledgable, friendly, and gave us a wonderful experience. The entire staff made sure our water was never less than half empty. We tried the recommended specials and we're not disappointed. We had to refrain from literally licking our plates.","Dined on March 8, 2014",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
Great lunch we had. Salmon cooked to perfect! All salmon lovers will know that it is hard to find a place that cooks your fish but doesn't over cook it. Service was very attentive and friendly. We will return. Thank you so much.,"Dined on March 8, 2014",4,4,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"A cool place for dinner, and the food is ""good"", but foodies will not be impressed. The seafood was just OK, maybe we should have had their specials, but we weren't at all impressed especially not for the price. My husband's cioppino had 2 hairs in it! He was too shy to say anything, especially since the waitress was so incredibly nice and he figures the hair was hers, but it was gross.","Dined on March 7, 2014",3,2,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"A friend and I recently enjoyed lunch at The Pink Door. This is not our first time at this restaurant. We have always found it to be a very reliable place. Service was warm and friendly -- as usual. The waiter guided us through the specials and encouraged us to try one of the appetizers -- a bagna cauda -- which was fabulous. When we ran out of veggies to dip into the sauce he had no problem with me pouring the leftover bagna cauda on my nicely done swordfish. All in all, a lovely meal.","Dined on March 6, 2014",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"We had a wonderful lunch. Everthing was delightful - the ambience (tall taper candle with dripping wax on gold candlestick was a beautiful change from the typical votive in a glass), the pleasant service, the cocktails (a negroni and house cockail - the celery made me do it), prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella, arugula and beet salad, mama's meatballs in ciabatta, and a lovely capuccino. We throughly enjoyed this little restaurant (there is no sign, just a pink door!) in the Pike Market area. Stop by the WA wine tasting shop just across Post Alley before or after your meal. We will try to go back to check out the evening bar scene - looks like a great place for an after-dinner cocktail.","Dined on March 5, 2014",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"Take the Italian countryside and go to a farm, then bring a gourmet chef and say make something with the ingredients on the farm. What you get is the fare at The Pink Door. Earthy, intelligent, well portioned, and at times brilliant. Both my wife and I had many bites that were perfect. The kind where you sit and reflect on what you just tasted, the kind where the sum of the parts exceeds the whole. Everything we had worked together on that Italian farm, we were transported. What more can you ask for from a plate of food?
The live trio really swings on Wed so that was a nice after dinner treat with our heavenly desert.","Dined on February 27, 2014",5,5,4,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"Disclaimer: I don't like fennel, so the menu, which contained many items with fennel, didn't appeal to me. But what was worse was the waiter, who was arrogant, not helpful, and inattentive. He also tried to add a gratuity to our bill even though we had only four in our party. I ate several other places in Seattle, all of them outstanding. By comparison, this place was mediocre.","Dined on February 27, 2014",2,2,1,3,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"The Good for Groups depends on the size - I'd say up to 12 would be comfortable. There was a table set for 10 while present.
Never tried Brunch nor Happy Hour or Late-Night.
It was a Great Lunch, all except our service was very slow at the end. We had to wait for our dessert and check an exceptionally long time. Making us late to get back to work.","Dined on February 27, 2014",4,5,3,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"We had a really, really good anniversary dinner at The Pink Door this past weekend. Great cocktail in the lounge before dinner, romantic atmosphere, incredible appetizer and entrees. Our server was prompt, polite, and attentive without being overbearing. The front desk staff was super cool. You have to look closely in Post Alley to find the place, but it IS the only pink door there....so....

I'd recommend a vist to The Pink Door for anyone going to Seattle for a couples retreat, anniversary, etc.","Dined on February 22, 2014",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"I surprised my girlfriend by taking her here for the first time for our Valentines Day, which happened to be a few days later than the 14th. We were extremely impressed with the ambiance and the service. The staff were friendly and waited on us hand and foot. The food was also great, I think the only complaint we had was that we wished the serving sizes were a little larger haha!

This is a great romantic restaurant for any couples looking for a special night out. The food is as good as the service, and the acrobatic shows are impressive. I definitely recommend going at least once.","Dined on February 18, 2014",4,4,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"We have eaten at the Pink Door every time we head to Seattle since we discovered it 4 years ago. I'm not a big calamari fan but can't get enough of theirs. Tender, juicy in a tasty, tasty sauce. The pastas are obviously house-made from scratch; sauces are complex and absolutely delicious. Our servers on every occasion have been wonderful--attentive but not overbearing and knowledgeable about menu details. This truly is one of our favorite restaurants. We haven't tried it for lunch or brunch and have not as yet been there at a time it was seasonable to sit on the deck but given our dinner experiences, cannot imagine that anything at Pink Door would be less than wonderful.","Dined on February 13, 2014",5,5,5,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11

"The staff was super friendly and so accommodating. We showed up a bit early for our 10 person reservations and they quickly escorted us to a much better waiting location than standing by the front door. Once our table was ready, the wait staff was so helpful and always there to meet our needs, but we never felt pressure to hurry our meals. The ambience was great (despite being very tight quarters with the other guests) and the food was delicious. This was only my 2nd time at the Pink Door but it will definitely not be my last.","Dined on February 9, 2014",4,4,4,4,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
"We have been to the Pink Door once before and loved the food and ambience. We decided to make a reservation for our 26th anniversary, and it was just as good or better than last time. The lasagna was delicious and ""felt"" healthy, not overly salty and I felt pleasantly full, not bloated or stuffed. My husband had pasta with a sausage that he also thought was delicious and of good quality. It wasn't very busy, so we enjoyed the quiet atmosphere, and the service was excellent.","Dined on February 9, 2014",5,5,5,5,The Pink Door,2024-12-11
