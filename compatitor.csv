"Really enjoyed our meal.  This was our first time there as a family (I was there in the 80’s)  and we were disappointed in the table they gave us - behind a column by the kitchen. I guess regulars get better tables but the food, service and value were excellent.","Dined on December 15, 2024",4,4,5,3,Cafe Luxembourg,2024-12-11

"This is the most recent of many trips to Luxembourg. The vibe is specifically New York upper west side feeling, tight tables, well-displayed food that is just fine.","Dined on December 15, 2024",4,4,5,4,Cafe Luxembourg,2024-12-11

"Cafe Luxembourg is truly a neighborhood gem.  I appreciated the kindness when I needed to change the reservation time and the attention to detail for the reservation. Our experience from start to finish exceeded expectations. Our server was was attentive and did not rush our dining experience even though they were busy. I definitely recommend the French onion soup and for my entree I had the delicious pork chop.  I did learn that was an item that would eventually leave the menu.  I was celebrating a birthday and ended with a sundae for sharing. Overall, this is a place where everyone feels welcome.","Dined on December 14, 2024",5,5,5,5,Cafe Luxembourg,2024-12-11
