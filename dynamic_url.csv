"Really enjoyed our meal.  This was our first time there as a family (I was there in the 80’s)  and we were disappointed in the table they gave us - behind a column by the kitchen. I guess regulars get better tables but the food, service and value were excellent.","Dined on December 15, 2024",4,4,5,3,Cafe Luxembourg,2024-12-11

"Cafe Luxembourg is truly a neighborhood gem.  I appreciated the kindness when I needed to change the reservation time and the attention to detail for the reservation. Our experience from start to finish exceeded expectations. Our server was was attentive and did not rush our dining experience even though they were busy. I definitely recommend the French onion soup and for my entree I had the delicious pork chop.  I did learn that was an item that would eventually leave the menu.  I was celebrating a birthday and ended with a sundae for sharing. Overall, this is a place where everyone feels welcome.","Dined on December 14, 2024",5,5,5,5,Cafe Luxembourg,2024-12-11

"Cozy neighborhood restaurant, but must have a reservation. Tables very close together, so depending on where you sit, you may be listening to the conversation of the adjacent table.

The menu is solid and traditional. The chef does not “chef” your food to death or plate your food with a tweezers.

Prices are just a bit on the high end  but consistency and good service are worth it.","Dined on December 1, 2024",4,4,5,4,Cafe Luxembourg,2024-12-11
"Onion Soup and Tartar were great.
The main course is average within the price.
Service is great and people are nice.
The place a bit too tight. Tables are very close.
Will be a great place to eat-in after or before the show.","Dined on December 1, 2024",4,4,5,4,Cafe Luxembourg,2024-12-11

"I am a regular at Cafe Luxembourg and I love it. I go at least once a week and usually, my experience is amazing. However, yesterday I was very disappointed. The manager, Zach, was extremely rude to me and my party. We had a reservation at 8:30 for 2 and as we arrived early with one extra person, we asked if there was a table for 3. Zach said a table was available at 9:30pm, despite there being empty tables, so we asked if we could sit outside and then be moved inside once our table was available. He said this was not possible because it would be too much of a hassle to move us inside?? Then, I asked him if there was anything we could do, as we saw available tables in the restaurant, to what he nonchalantly replied: no. So I went on the OpenTable app and found more tables available for a party of 3 at 8:30, and I asked him if I could reserve a table, to what he said: I suppose you could. Then, my friend went to the restroom and on her way she took a selfie, as the restaurant is very nice obviously. Zach glided across the restaurant to berate her and tell her it was rude to snap pictures; to delete and never do that again. Overall, he was rude and we felt stared down at. Cafe Luxembourg is one of my favorite restaurants, but experiences like these definitely make you think twice about dining there again.","Dined on November 14, 2024",1,5,1,2,Cafe Luxembourg,2024-12-11
"My reviews are becoming repetitious but happily they remain consistently positive. As always the Cafe is a wonderful place to dine. The food has never disappointed, the service continues to be attentive and efficient and the staff personable without being intrusive. Moreover, given today's economic climate the value, portions and quality of what is served is more than fair. I always look forward to returning.","Dined on November 14, 2024",5,5,5,5,Cafe Luxembourg,2024-12-11

"Biggest rip off ever! I ordered the steak frites and it comes super thin, thinnest steak I’ve ever seen in my life at a proper restaurant. I ate it, paid, waiting to leave and then saw the table next to me order the same dish but it was regular sized thick steaks. That got me really upset. I don’t even know how to complain to management about this issue other than leave my review and let others be warned. Inconsistent and frustrating. Do not eat here.","Dined on November 2, 2024",1,1,5,4,Cafe Luxembourg,2024-12-11
